The TensorFlow model should contain a while loop where certain instructions within the loop body are invariant, meaning they produce the same output regardless of the loop iteration. These instructions can be hoisted out of the loop to improve performance. 

The `WhileLoopInvariantCodeMotion` optimization pass is triggered when the following conditions are met:

1. The while loop's body computation is a tuple. This is because the optimization pass currently only supports hoisting from tuple computations. 

2. The while loop has more than one iteration. If the loop has a trip count of at most 1, the optimization pass is skipped.

3. The while loop's body computation contains instructions that are invariant and worth hoisting. These instructions do not have side effects, are not parameters, do not have control predecessors or successors, and their operands are also invariant. 

4. The hoisting of the invariant instructions does not cause a significant memory blow-up. This is checked by comparing the output size of the instruction to the input size. If the output size is significantly larger than the input size, the instruction is not hoisted.

5. The while loop does not contain domain instructions or host offloading annotations. These instructions should stay in their original position.

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization pass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function(jit_compile=True)
def foo(x):
    for _ in tf.range(10):
        x = tf.constant(1) + x  # This constant can be hoisted out of the loop
    return x

foo(tf.constant(0))
```

In this example, the constant `tf.constant(1)` is invariant and can be hoisted out of the loop by the `WhileLoopInvariantCodeMotion` optimization pass.
