The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.cast(input_tensor, dtype1)
t2 = tf.cast(t1, dtype2)
...
tn = tf.cast(tn-1, dtypeN)
```
The pattern describes that there are multiple consecutive cast operators in the model. Each `tf.cast` operator transforms a tensor from one floating-point data type to another. The optimization is triggered when there are at least two consecutive cast operations and the final data type is the same as the initial data type.
