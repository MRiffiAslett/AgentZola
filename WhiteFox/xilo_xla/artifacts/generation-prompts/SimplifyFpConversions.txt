Generate a valid TensorFlow model for SimplifyFpConversions that meets the requirements.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model for `SimplifyFpConversions` Optimization

The `SimplifyFpConversions` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains a specific pattern of floating-point conversion operations. Here are the key characteristics:

1. **Sequential Floating-Point Conversions:**
   The model must have a sequence of at least two consecutive `Convert` operations where each operation is converting between floating-point data types. This pattern can be represented in a TensorFlow model where data is cast from one floating-point type to another and then to another.

2. **Same Start and End Types:**
   The initial floating-point type of the first conversion in the sequence and the final type after the last conversion must be the same. This means the optimizations can simplify the entire sequence to either a no-op (if the types are the same) or a single conversion operation (if the types are different initially but end up the same).

### Example Model

Here is a TensorFlow model example in Python that would trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming a TensorFlow setup that uses XLA compilation:
tf.config.optimizer.set_jit(True)  # Enable XLA

# Define a simple model
class MyModel(tf.Module):
    @tf.function
    def convert_sequence(self, x):
        x = tf.cast(x, tf.float32)  # First conversion
        x = tf.cast(x, tf.float64)  # Second conversion
        x = tf.cast(x, tf.float32)  # Third conversion, converting back to the original type
        return x

# Create an instance of the model and apply a sequence of conversions
model = MyModel()
input_tensor = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float16)  # Starting with float16
output_tensor = model.convert_sequence(input_tensor)

# Print the output
print(output_tensor)
```

In this example:
- The tensor `x` is initially in `float16`.
- It is first converted to `float32`, then to `float64`, and finally back to `float32`.
- The `SimplifyFpConversions` pass would detect this pattern since it involves multiple conversions ending in the same type as one of the previous types in the sequence.
- As a result, the optimization could simplify this to either no conversion if deemed unnecessary or just a single conversion directly from `float16` to `float32`, depending on intermediate usage and computational requirements.

This TensorFlow model illustrates the type of data manipulation and operation sequence that would activate the `SimplifyFpConversions` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA.
