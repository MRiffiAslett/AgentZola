The TensorFlow model triggers the optimization pass `SliceSinker` in TensorFlow XLA when it contains a group of elementwise operations on slices that meet the following conditions:

1. The operands of each operation are slices taken from the same indices of larger tensors with the same dimensions.
2. All operations have the same opcode.
3. The corresponding operands of all operations are slices taken from the same larger tensors.
4. The accumulated size of the group of operations is not less than the size of such a larger tensor. This is a heuristic to ensure that the transformation never causes us to do more elementwise operations.

Here is an example of a model that would trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor
p = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], dtype=tf.float32)

# Define slices
a = tf.slice(p, [0], [6])
b = tf.slice(p, [6], [4])

# Define elementwise operations
aa = tf.add(a, a)
bb = tf.add(b, b)
```

In this example, the operations `aa` and `bb` are elementwise operations on slices `a` and `b` of tensor `p`. They meet the conditions described above, so they would trigger the `SliceSinker` optimization pass.
