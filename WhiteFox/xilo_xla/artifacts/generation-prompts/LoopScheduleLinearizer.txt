The model should contain a loop structure (i.e., a `while` operation) that does not contain any asynchronous collective operations. The loop's body computation should have a specific pattern of data dependencies where a value is written and then read in the same loop iteration. 

The `LoopScheduleLinearizer` optimization pass is triggered when it can add control dependencies to ensure that these reads happen before the corresponding writes, without introducing a cycle in the computation graph. 

The optimization pass is not applied if the loop body contains asynchronous collective operations, as the additional control dependencies could constrain scheduling and hamper compute and communication overlap. 

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that could trigger this optimization pass:

```python
i = tf.constant(0)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i, 10)

def body(i):
    v = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10, 10]))
    v = v + i  # write
    i = i + 1
    v = v + i  # read
    return i

r = tf.while_loop(c, body, [i])
```

In this example, the variable `v` is written and then read in the same loop iteration. The `LoopScheduleLinearizer` optimization pass could add a control dependency to ensure that the read of `v` happens after the write.
