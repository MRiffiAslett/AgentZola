Generate a valid TensorFlow model for LoopScheduleLinearizer that meets the requirements.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Models Triggering `LoopScheduleLinearizer` Optimization

The `LoopScheduleLinearizer` optimization in TensorFlow XLA is specifically designed to handle scenarios in TensorFlow models containing `While` loops where additional control dependencies can be introduced to prevent hazards such as write-after-read or read-after-write. The key characteristics of models that trigger this optimization are:

1. **Presence of `While` Loops:**
   The model must contain at least one `While` loop. The optimization pass scans through the instructions of each computation in the model, looking specifically for instructions with an opcode of `kWhile`.

   ```python
   tf.while_loop(cond, body, [initial_values])
   ```

2. **Absence of Async Collectives in Loop Body:**
   The body of the `While` loop should not contain asynchronous collective operations. These include operations that start or end asynchronous collectives, as their presence skips the optimization to avoid potential scheduling constraints that could affect performance.

   ```python
   # Example of what should not be present in the loop body
   tf.raw_ops.CollectiveReduce(...)
   ```

3. **Simple Data Dependencies:**
   The optimization targets `While` loops where there are straightforward data dependencies that do not involve complex scenarios like nested tuples or aliasing issues. The primary focus is on single values or simple structures that can be traced back directly to their defining instructions within the loop.

   ```python
   # Simplified example of loop variables being traced
   i = loop_var
   result = i + 1  # Direct dependency
   ```

4. **Potential to Introduce Control Dependencies:**
   The optimization can be applied when it is feasible to add control dependencies between read and write operations within the loop without introducing cycles in the computation graph. This is assessed dynamically by attempting to insert edges in a computation graph model and checking for cycles.

   ```python
   # Hypothetical scenario where adding control dependency is considered
   if not already_dependent(read_op, write_op):
       try_add_dependency(read_op, write_op)
   ```

A TensorFlow model that includes such characteristics, particularly `While` loops with simple and direct data dependencies and without asynchronous collectives, is a candidate for this optimization pass. The purpose is to ensure more predictable execution by linearizing the schedule of operations within the loop, thereby potentially improving the performance and stability of the model during execution.
