The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.broadcast_to(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.all_gather(t1, ...)
```
The pattern describes that there is an `all_gather` operator in the model, which takes the output of a `broadcast` operator as its operand. The `all_gather` operator should operate on an array, and the `broadcast` operator should be the first operand of the `all_gather` operator.

The optimization pass `AllGatherBroadcastReorder` is triggered when the model contains an `all_gather` operation that is fed by a `broadcast` operation. The optimization pass reorders these operations to perform the `all_gather` operation first and then the `broadcast` operation. This is beneficial when there are uniform dimensions in the `all_gather` result that have a size greater than 1, as the `all_gather` operation will be operating on smaller data. 

The optimization pass also handles two cases: 
1. If the `all_gather` happens along one of the non-uniform dimensions of the `broadcast`, then it issues `all_gather(x)` and then a `broadcast`.
2. If the `all_gather` happens along one of the uniform dimensions of the `broadcast`, that dimension does not exist in `x`. In this case, it reshapes `x` to add a leading '1' dimension, performs `all_gather`, then issues a `broadcast` which matches the existing `all_gather` shape, and finally "flattens" the dimensions by issuing a final reshape. 

The function will return true if any of these transformations are applied, indicating that the model has been changed.
