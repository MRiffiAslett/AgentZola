The TensorFlow model should contain operations that use a specific primitive type that needs to be replaced with another primitive type. The `HloElementTypeConverter` optimization pass is triggered when the model contains operations that use the `eliminate_type_` and these operations are not among the ones that are excluded from conversion (e.g., `kParameter`, `kConstant`, `kTuple`, `kConvert`, `kBitcastConvert`, `kGetTupleElement`, `kInfeed`, `kOutfeed`, `kCustomCall`, and others with embedded computations). 

The model should contain operations that perform arithmetic operations and contain operands with `eliminate_type_`. These operands are converted to `replace_with_type_`. If the result of the operation is also of `eliminate_type_`, it is converted to `replace_with_type_` and then back to `eliminate_type_`. If the result is a tuple, the elements of the tuple that are of `eliminate_type_` are converted to `replace_with_type_` and then back to `eliminate_type_`. 

For example, if `eliminate_type_` is `F32` and `replace_with_type_` is `F64`, an operation in the model like `t1 = tf.add(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float32), tf.constant([3.0, 4.0], dtype=tf.float32))` would trigger the optimization pass.
