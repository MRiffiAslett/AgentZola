The model should contain a `tf.reduce_*` operation (like `tf.reduce_sum`, `tf.reduce_max`, etc.) where at least one of the dimensions being reduced is larger than a certain window size. This window size is a parameter for the `TreeReductionRewriter` optimization pass.

The pattern can be illustrated as follows:

```python
t1 = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor, axis=some_axis)
```

In this pattern, `input_tensor` is the tensor being reduced, `tf.reduce_sum` is the reduction operation, and `some_axis` is the axis along which the reduction is performed. The `TreeReductionRewriter` optimization pass is triggered when the size of `some_axis` is larger than the specified window size. 

Note that the optimization pass is not applied if all dimensions being reduced are smaller than the window size. Also, the optimization pass is not applied for variadic reductions.
