### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model that Trigger `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by a specific pattern in the TensorFlow model involving two consecutive `tf.reshape` operations. The characteristics of the model that would cause this optimization to be applied are:

1. **Sequential Reshape Operations:** The model must contain two consecutive `reshape` operations.
2. **Shape Reversal Pattern:** The second `reshape` operation reverses the shape transformation applied by the first `reshape`. This means that the output tensor of the second `reshape` returns to the original shape of the tensor before the first `reshape`.

#### Example Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal([8, 16])
# First reshape: Changes the shape
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [2, 64])
# Second reshape: Reverses the first reshape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 16])
```
In this example, the second `reshape` reverts the tensor `t1` back to the original shape of `input_tensor`. This pattern will trigger the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization, where the two reshapes can be effectively removed, directly using `input_tensor` instead of `t2`.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model that Trigger `TreeReductionRewriter` Optimization

The `TreeReductionRewriter` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA optimizes reduction operations that are split across multiple dimensions. This optimization is effective for large-scale reductions and is triggered under the following conditions:

1. **Presence of a `reduce` Operation:** The TensorFlow model must include a reduction operation (`tf.reduce_*` such as `tf.reduce_sum`, `tf.reduce_max`).
2. **Large Reduction Dimensions:** At least one of the dimensions being reduced should have a size larger than the specified `reduce_window_size` in the rewriter configuration, which suggests a potential benefit from breaking down the reduction into smaller, more manageable operations.

#### Example Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Large input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([1024, 2048])
# Reduction across both dimensions but primarily large in the second dimension
result = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor, axis=[0, 1])
```
In this scenario, if the `reduce_window_size` is set smaller than `2048`, the `TreeReductionRewriter` might partition the reduction into smaller window-based reductions before performing the final reduction, optimizing the overall computational effort and possibly improving parallelism.

These descriptions and examples outline how specific patterns and configurations in a TensorFlow model can trigger these optimization passes in TensorFlow XLA.
