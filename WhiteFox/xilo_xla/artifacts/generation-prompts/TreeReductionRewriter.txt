### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Description of TensorFlow Model Characteristics for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding`

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains a sequence of two reshape operations where the first reshape changes the shape of a tensor, and the second reshape operation reverts it back to the original shape. This specific pattern is characterized by the following:

1. **Two Consecutive Reshape Operations**: The model includes two consecutive `tf.reshape` operations.
2. **First Reshape Alteration and Reversion by Second**: The first reshape operation changes the shape of an input tensor to any other shape, and the second reshape operation changes it back to its original shape.

#### Code Example:
```python
# Example TensorFlow code that would trigger the ReshapeReshapeForwarding optimization.
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal([10, 20])
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [200])  # First reshape to a different shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [10, 20])        # Second reshape that reverts to the original shape

# t2 can be directly replaced by input_tensor through the optimization.
```

### Description of TensorFlow Model Characteristics for `TreeReductionRewriter`

The `TreeReductionRewriter` optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains a reduction operation that can be rewritten as a combination of a `ReduceWindow` operation followed by a `Reduce` operation to improve performance. This transformation is suited for scenarios where the reduction dimension size is larger than a predefined window size. The characteristics include:

1. **Reduction Operation with Large Dimension**: The model should include a reduction operation where at least one of the dimensions being reduced is larger than a predefined window size (`reduce_window_size_`).
2. **Non-Variadic Reductions**: The optimization currently targets non-variadic reductions only.

#### Code Example:
```python
# Example TensorFlow code that might trigger the TreeReductionRewriter optimization.
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal([100, 200])
# Sum reduction across the first dimension
result = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor, axis=0)

# If the first dimension (size 100) is considered large (e.g., greater than reduce_window_size_),
# this could be optimized by first applying a reduce window operation followed by a reduce operation.
```

In both cases, the presence of these specific patterns and properties in a TensorFlow model triggers the respective optimizations during the XLA compilation process, potentially leading to performance improvements by simplifying the computation graph or by more efficiently mapping the computations in hardware-aware manners.
