The model should contain a `tf.cond` operation (which is represented as `HloOpcode::kConditional` in XLA) where the inputs and/or outputs of the conditional branches are not tuples. 

The `ConditionalCanonicalizer` optimization pass is triggered when the following conditions are met:

1. The model contains a `tf.cond` operation.
2. The inputs or outputs of the conditional branches are not tuples. This includes the case where the conditional branches have multiple inputs or outputs that are not packed into a tuple, or the case where the conditional branches have a single input or output that is not a tuple.

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization pass:

```python
def true_fn(x):
  return x * 2

def false_fn(x):
  return x + 2

x = tf.constant(5)
y = tf.cond(tf.constant(True), lambda: true_fn(x), lambda: false_fn(x))
```

In this example, the `true_fn` and `false_fn` functions each take a single non-tuple input `x` and return a single non-tuple output. This would trigger the `ConditionalCanonicalizer` optimization pass, which would canonicalize the inputs and outputs of the conditional branches to tuples.
