The model should contain multiple AllGather operations that can be combined into a single AllGather operation. The characteristics of these AllGather operations are:

1. They are in the same computation.
2. They have the same all_gather_dimension if the `combine_by_dim` flag is set.
3. They have the same data type if the `combine_different_dtypes` flag is not set.
4. They have the same replica groups.
5. They have the same channel_id if it exists.
6. They use the same global device ids.

The total size of the operands of these AllGather operations should exceed the `combine_threshold_in_bytes` and the total number of these AllGather operations should exceed the `combine_threshold_count`.

Here is an example of such a pattern:

```python
t1 = tf.distribute.all_gather(input_tensor1, axis=0)
t2 = tf.distribute.all_gather(input_tensor2, axis=0)
```

In this example, `t1` and `t2` are AllGather operations that can be combined into a single AllGather operation if `input_tensor1` and `input_tensor2` have the same data type and the total size of `input_tensor1` and `input_tensor2` exceeds the `combine_threshold_in_bytes`.
