### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model to Trigger `ReshapeReshapeForwarding`

To trigger the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization in TensorFlow XLA, the model must contain two consecutive `tf.reshape` operations where the second reshape operation reverses the shape transformation applied by the first reshape operation.

**Pattern Required:**
1. The first `reshape` operation changes an input tensor (`input_tensor`) from its original shape to any arbitrary new shape.
2. The second `reshape` operation then changes the shape of the tensor resulting from the first reshape operation back to the original shape of `input_tensor`.

**Example Code:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming input_tensor is a TensorFlow tensor with a known shape
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [some_shape])  # first reshape to some_shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)      # second reshape to original shape
```
In this case, `t2` effectively becomes a redundant operation that can be optimized out, reverting directly to `input_tensor`.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model to Trigger `AllGatherCombiner`

For the `AllGatherCombiner` optimization, the model must contain multiple `tf.all_gather` operations that can potentially be combined into a single operation. Specific conditions include:

1. All gather operations to be combined must be operating over tensors of compatible shapes and data types.
2. They should ideally target the same gather dimension or have the flexibility (controlled by the `combine_by_dim` flag) to ignore dimension mismatches.
3. The combined size of the tensors involved in the gather operations should exceed a predefined byte threshold (`combine_threshold_in_bytes`) to make the combination beneficial.
4. The gather operations should not be involved in layout-constrained collective operations that could prevent rearrangements.

**Example Code:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Tenor and gather operations
tensor_a = tf.constant([...])
tensor_b = tf.constant([...])

gather_a = tf.all_gather(tensor_a, axis=0)
gather_b = tf.all_gather(tensor_b, axis=0)

# Other operations can be here...

# Assuming gather_a and gather_b are compatible and exceed the byte threshold,
# and there are no layout constraints, these could be combined into a single operation by the optimizer.
```
In this setup, if `gather_a` and `gather_b` meet the criteria, including the same or ignored gather dimensions, similar data types (or if differing data types are permitted), and size thresholds, then they may be combined to optimize execution.
