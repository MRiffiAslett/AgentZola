The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.cast(input_tensor, dtype=input_tensor.dtype)
```
The pattern describes that there is a `cast` operator in the model that attempts to convert a tensor `input_tensor` from its original data type to the same data type. This is essentially an identity operation and does not change the tensor.
