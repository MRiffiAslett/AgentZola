The model should contain the following pattern:

```
lhs = tf.Variable(...)
rhs0 = tf.Variable(...)
rhs1 = tf.Variable(...)
dot0 = tf.linalg.matmul(lhs, rhs0)
dot1 = tf.linalg.matmul(lhs, rhs1)
```

The pattern describes that there are two `matmul` operators in the model. Both `matmul` operators share the same left-hand-side operand `lhs` but have different right-hand-side operands `rhs0` and `rhs1`. 

The `DotMerger` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered when there are multiple dot (matrix multiplication) operations in the model that share an operand. The optimization pass attempts to merge these operations into a single dot operation followed by slice operations to achieve the same result. This can potentially reduce the computational cost and memory usage. 

The `MergeDots` function checks if the two dot operations can be merged based on several conditions, such as whether they share an operand, whether they have the same layout, and whether they have the same operand precision. If all conditions are met, the function attempts to merge the two dot operations. If the merge is successful, the function returns true, indicating that the optimization pass has been triggered.
