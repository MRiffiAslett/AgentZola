Generate a valid TensorFlow model for DotMerger that meets the requirements.

The `DotMerger` optimization in TensorFlow XLA is triggered for TensorFlow models that contain multiple dot product operations (`tf.linalg.matmul` in TensorFlow's Python API) sharing common operands and meeting specific dimensional and layout requirements. This optimization aims to merge these dot operations into a single, more efficient operation. Characteristics of models that would lead to triggering this optimization include:

1. **Multiple Dot Operations with Shared Operands**: Models where several dot operations share the same left-hand-side (LHS) or right-hand-side (RHS) operand. For example, if `A` and `B` are matrices, models performing multiple operations like `dot(A, B)` and `dot(A, C)` can be optimized.

   ```python
   # TensorFlow equivalent
   A = tf.random.normal([200, 100])
   B = tf.random.normal([100, 10])
   C = tf.random.normal([100, 50])
   dot1 = tf.linalg.matmul(A, B)
   dot2 = tf.linalg.matmul(A, C)
   ```

2. **Matching Dimension and Element Types**: The dot operations must have operands with matching element types. If the element types of the operands in the dot products don't match, the optimization won't trigger.

3. **Consistency in Dimension Numbers**: The contracting and batch dimensions of the dot operations must be consistent. If two dot operations have different contracting dimensions, they cannot be merged.

4. **Layout Compatibility**: The layouts (memory order of dimensions) of the operands involved in the dot operations should be compatible or identical. This is crucial for efficient concatenation and slicing during the merging process.

5. **Absence of Batch Dimensions**: The current implementation does not support batch dimensions in the dot operations. Only dot operations without batch dimensions and of rank 2 are considered for merging.

6. **Size Limitations**: The combined size of the operands and the output of the dot operations must not exceed a predefined maximum size (`max_size_to_merge`). This ensures that the merged operation does not consume excessive memory or computational resources.

7. **No Transitive Dependencies**: The dot operations to be merged should not have dependencies on each other's values, meaning one operation’s output should not be an input to the other in any form that affects ordering constraints.

8. **Absence of Control Dependencies**: Dot operations with control dependencies are not considered for merging. Control dependencies can affect the execution order and merging such operations could lead to incorrect results or execution failures.

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model where `DotMerger` might be applied:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume A, B, C are defined as compatible matrices for dot products
A = tf.random.normal([200, 100])
B = tf.random.normal([100, 10])
C = tf.random.normal([100, 50])

# Multiple dot products sharing the same operand `A`
dot1 = tf.linalg.matmul(A, B)
dot2 = tf.linalg.matmul(A, C)

# Further operations might depend on dot1 and dot2
result = tf.add(dot1, tf.reduce_sum(dot2))
```

In this scenario, if `dot1` and `dot2` are eligible based on the criteria above, they could be merged into a single operation to improve computational efficiency. The optimization would replace multiple smaller dot operations with a single larger one, potentially concatenating `B` and `C` and then splitting the result after the combined dot product.
