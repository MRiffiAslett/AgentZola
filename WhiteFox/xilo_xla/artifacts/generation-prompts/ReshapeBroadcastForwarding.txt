### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeBroadcastForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain a pattern where a scalar tensor is broadcast to a 1-D tensor
of size 1, and then reshaped back to a scalar:
```
x = tf.constant(3.14)               # scalar, shape []
b = tf.broadcast_to(x, [1])         # broadcast scalar -> shape [1]
result = tf.reshape(b, [])          # reshape back to scalar []
```
The optimization detects this round-trip pattern (scalar -> [1] -> scalar) and replaces
it with the original scalar tensor directly. Requirements:
- The input to broadcast must be a scalar (rank 0).
- The broadcast output must be rank 1 (shape [1]).
- The reshape output must be rank 0 (scalar).
