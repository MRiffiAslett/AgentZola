The model should contain the following patterns:

1. Increase precision "down" the graph:
   ```
   t1 = tf.cast(input_tensor, tf.float32)
   t2 = tf.some_op(t1)
   ```
   The pattern describes that there is a `cast` operator that increases the precision of a tensor `input_tensor` (e.g., from `float16` to `float32`), and then the output of the `cast` operator is used as an input to some other operator `some_op`. The operator `some_op` should be one of the following: `Concatenate`, `Pad`, `Reshape`, `Slice`, `Transpose`. Also, the `cast` operator should be the only user of `input_tensor`.

2. Decrease precision "up" the graph:
   ```
   t1 = tf.some_op(input_tensor)
   t2 = tf.cast(t1, tf.float16)
   ```
   The pattern describes that there is a `cast` operator that decreases the precision of a tensor `t1` (e.g., from `float32` to `float16`), where `t1` is the output of some other operator `some_op`. The operator `some_op` should be one of the following: `Concatenate`, `Pad`, `Reshape`, `Slice`, `Transpose`. Also, the `cast` operator should be the only user of `t1`.

In both cases, the `cast` operator should not be converting between types with the same or greater bit width (e.g., from `float32` to `float32` or from `float16` to `float32`). Also, packed types (types with bit width less than 8) are not supported.
