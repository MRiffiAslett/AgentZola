### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Description of TensorFlow Model Characteristics for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding`

The TensorFlow model characteristics that trigger the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA involve two consecutive reshape operations where the output shape of the second reshape operation matches the input shape of the first reshape operation. Specifically, the model should exhibit the following pattern:

1. An initial tensor `input_tensor` is reshaped to any other shape.
2. The resulting tensor from the first reshape operation is then reshaped back to the original shape of `input_tensor`.

This effectively forms a reshape sequence that is redundant and can be optimized away, leaving `input_tensor` unchanged.

#### Example in TensorFlow code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume input_tensor is a TensorFlow tensor with some predefined shape
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([8, 16])

# First reshape operation (any target shape)
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [2, 64])

# Second reshape operation (back to the original shape of input_tensor)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 16])

# Here, t2 is effectively the same as input_tensor after optimization
```

This optimization pass is beneficial for reducing unnecessary computational operations in the model, simplifying the computation graph, and potentially enhancing execution speed.

### Description of TensorFlow Model Characteristics for `ConvertMover`

The `ConvertMover` optimization pass is triggered in a TensorFlow model where there are precision converting operations that can be moved across other operations without changing the overall computation's outcome. This optimization targets scenarios where:

1. Converting the precision of a tensor and then applying an operation that is compatible with the convert operation in terms of data commutation properties.
2. The operations that are compatible with precision conversion include operations like concatenate, pad, reshape, slice, and transpose.

The optimization aims to adjust the position of precision conversion operations (`tf.cast` in TensorFlow) to either:
- Increase precision before an operation if it leads to more accurate results or computational stability.
- Decrease precision after an operation if it can save computational resources without a significant loss of accuracy.

#### Example in TensorFlow code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume x is a tensor of dtype float16
x = tf.random.uniform([10, 10], dtype=tf.float16)

# Convert x to float32 and then apply a reshape operation
y = tf.cast(x, tf.float32)
z = tf.reshape(y, [20, 5])

# ConvertMover may optimize this to:
# Apply the reshape operation first and then convert the precision
optimized_z = tf.cast(tf.reshape(x, [20, 5]), tf.float32)
```

This optimization is beneficial for improving the efficiency of memory usage and computational speed by strategically placing precision adjustments in the computation graph. It seeks to ensure that precision conversions are applied in a manner that maximizes their utility while minimizing unnecessary computational overhead.
