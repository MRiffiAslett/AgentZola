### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Characteristics of the TensorFlow Model for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization in TensorFlow XLA is triggered when a model contains a sequence of two reshape operations where the first reshape changes the shape of a tensor, and the second reshape changes it back to the original shape.

#### Model Pattern:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor of any shape
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([8, 16])

# First reshape operation changing the shape
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [4, 32])

# Second reshape operation restoring the original shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 16])
```

**Characteristics:**
- The model must contain two consecutive reshape operations.
- The output shape of the second reshape must match the input shape of the tensor fed into the first reshape.
- The intermediate shapes can be arbitrary but must be valid given the size of the original input tensor.

### Characteristics of the TensorFlow Model for `AllReduceCombiner` Optimization

The `AllReduceCombiner` optimization is triggered in a TensorFlow model that involves multiple `AllReduce` operations which can be combined into a single `AllReduce` operation, based on specific criteria such as the operation being performed (like sum, max) and the shapes of the tensors involved.

#### Model Pattern:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensors
input_tensor1 = tf.random.normal([8, 16])
input_tensor2 = tf.random.normal([8, 16])

# AllReduce operations on different tensors
ar1 = tf.raw_ops.AllReduce(input_tensor1, reduction="Add", group_assignment=[list(range(8))])
ar2 = tf.raw_ops.AllReduce(input_tensor2, reduction="Add", group_assignment=[list(range(8))])
```

**Characteristics:**
- The model contains multiple `AllReduce` operations.
- All `AllReduce` operations must use the same type of reduction (e.g., sum, max).
- The tensors involved in these `AllReduce` operations should be compatible for a combined operation, meaning they have the same shape or can be combined into a tuple structure.
- There should be no layout constraints on the `AllReduce` operations that would prevent them from being combined.

These characteristics define when the specific optimizations are applicable in the TensorFlow XLA environment.
