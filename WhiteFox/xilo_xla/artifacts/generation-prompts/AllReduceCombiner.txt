The model should contain multiple AllReduce operations that can be combined into a single AllReduce operation. The AllReduce operations must have the same reduction operation and each AllReduce operation must have exactly one operand. 

The pattern in the model would look something like this:

```python
t1 = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor1)
t2 = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor2)
...
tn = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensorn)
```

In this pattern, each `tf.reduce_sum` operation is an AllReduce operation. The `AllReduceCombiner` optimization pass will combine these separate AllReduce operations into a single AllReduce operation, which can improve the performance of the model. 

The optimization pass is triggered when the total size of the operands of the AllReduce operations exceeds a certain threshold (`combine_threshold_in_bytes_`) and the number of AllReduce operations exceeds another threshold (`combine_threshold_count_`). 

Note that the optimization pass will not be triggered if the model contains AllReduce operations with constrained layouts.
