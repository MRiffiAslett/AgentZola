The TensorFlow model triggers the optimization pass `HloCSE` in TensorFlow XLA when it contains duplicate computations that can be eliminated. This includes duplicate constants, duplicate iota instructions, and duplicate instructions that have the same operands and perform the same operation. 

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```python
x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
y = tf.add(x, x)
z = tf.add(x, x)
```

In this case, `y` and `z` are performing the same computation (`tf.add(x, x)`), so one of them can be eliminated to optimize the model.

The model also triggers the optimization pass when it contains instructions that can be safely removed without affecting the final result. This includes instructions that have no side effects and are not used by any other instructions.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```python
x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
y = tf.add(x, x)
z = tf.add(y, y)
```

In this case, `y` is not used by any other instructions after `z` is computed, so it can be safely removed to optimize the model.

Note that the optimization pass is sensitive to the layout of the tensors in the model. If the layout of the tensors changes, the optimization pass may not be triggered.
