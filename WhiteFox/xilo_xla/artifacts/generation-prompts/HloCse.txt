Generate a valid TensorFlow model for HloCse that meets the requirements.

The `HloCse` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by certain characteristics in a TensorFlow model which make it possible to simplify the computational graph by eliminating redundant computations. This pass identifies and removes identical computations across the model. Here are the specific characteristics of TensorFlow models that would trigger these optimizations:

1. **Presence of Identical Computations:**
   The model contains multiple instances of the same computation. For example, if the same mathematical operation with the same inputs appears multiple times in different parts of the graph, `HloCse` can replace these multiple instances with a single computation, reducing redundancy.

   ```python
   # Example in TensorFlow
   x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
   y = tf.add(x, x)
   z = tf.add(x, x)  # Redundant computation
   ```

2. **Commutative Operations with Same Operands:**
   Operations that are commutative (e.g., addition, multiplication) and have the same operands appearing in different orders can trigger this optimization because the order of operands does not affect the result.

   ```python
   a = tf.multiply(x, y)
   b = tf.multiply(y, x)  # Identical due to commutativity of multiplication
   ```

3. **Operations with the Same Constants or Iotas:**
   Operations that involve constants or sequences generated by `tf.range` (similar to the XLA `Iota` instruction) can be optimized if these constants or sequences are used identically across different parts of the model.

   ```python
   c = tf.constant([3, 4, 5])
   d = tf.add(x, c)
   e = tf.add(x, tf.constant([3, 4, 5]))  # Redundant constant usage
   ```

4. **Side-Effect Free Instructions:**
   Only computations without side effects are considered for this optimization. Operations that alter the state outside their scope (e.g., updating a variable, printing, or I/O operations) are not optimized to ensure that critical side effects are not inadvertently removed.

5. **Safe Removal Conditions:**
   The optimization only applies to instructions that can be safely removed without affecting the overall correctness of the program. This includes ensuring that no other parts of the computation depend on the unique aspects of the instruction being considered for removal.

By identifying these characteristics in TensorFlow models, the `HloCse` optimization can effectively reduce computational redundancy, which can lead to performance improvements both in terms of speed and resource usage.
