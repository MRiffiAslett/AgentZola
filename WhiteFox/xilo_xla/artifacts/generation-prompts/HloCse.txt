### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization

For the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA to be triggered, the TensorFlow model must have a specific sequence of reshape operations. The characteristics include:

1. **Two Consecutive Reshape Operations**: The model must perform two consecutive reshape operations on a tensor.
2. **Reversal of Shape**: The second reshape operation must revert the tensor back to its original shape. This means that after the first reshape changes the shape of the tensor, the second reshape changes it back to the shape it had before the first reshape.

#### Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor of arbitrary shape
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([8, 16])

# First reshape operation changing the shape
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [4, 32])

# Second reshape operation reverting to original shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 16])
```

In this example, `t2` would trigger the optimization because it reshapes `t1` back to the original shape of `input_tensor`.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model for `HloCSE` Optimization

The `HloCSE` (Common Subexpression Elimination) optimization pass aims to identify and eliminate duplicate computations. The characteristics for triggering this optimization include:

1. **Identical Subcomputations**: The model must have identical subcomputations within a single computation. This means multiple instructions in the XLA graph that perform the same operation with the same operands and produce the same results.
2. **No Side Effects**: The operations considered for elimination should not have any side effects.
3. **Safe to Remove**: The operations must not affect the semantics of the program if removed, i.e., they are not involved in control dependencies that affect execution.

#### Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensors
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])

# Identical operations
c1 = tf.add(a, b)
c2 = tf.add(a, b)
```

In this example, `c1` and `c2` are identical operations and would be candidates for elimination by the `HloCSE` optimization. In the XLA graph, these would be represented as two `add` operations with the same operands, and one of them could be eliminated to reduce redundancy.
