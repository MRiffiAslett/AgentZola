The TensorFlow model triggers the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA when it contains a sequence of two reshape operations where the second reshape operation reverts the shape of the tensor back to its original shape before the first reshape operation. 

In other words, the model should have a pattern where a tensor is first reshaped into a new shape and then reshaped back to its original shape. This can be represented as:

```python
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, new_shape)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, original_shape)
```

Here, `input_tensor` is the original tensor, `new_shape` is the shape after the first reshape operation, and `original_shape` is the shape of `input_tensor`. The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass is triggered when the shape of `t2` is equal to the shape of `input_tensor`.
