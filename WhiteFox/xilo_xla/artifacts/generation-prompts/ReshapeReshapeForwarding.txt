### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain two consecutive reshape operations where the second reshape
restores the original shape of the input tensor:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, new_shape)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The first `tf.reshape` transforms `input_tensor` from its original shape to any
different shape, and the second `tf.reshape` transforms the result back to
`input_tensor.shape`. The optimization detects this round-trip pattern and replaces
it with the original tensor directly.
