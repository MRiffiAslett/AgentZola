### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The TensorFlow XLA optimization pass `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` triggers when specific conditions regarding the invariance and computational expense of operations within a TensorFlow model's while loop body are met. Here are the characteristics of a TensorFlow model that would activate this optimization:

1. **Tuple-Shaped While Instruction**: The while loop must operate on a tuple-shaped state. This is a requirement because the optimization pass does not generalize to non-tuple states. If the while loop state is not a tuple, the function returns false early.

2. **While Loop with More than One Iteration**: The optimization pass skips loops that are determined to have at most one iteration. If the upper bound of the loop’s trip count is computed to be one or less, the optimization does not proceed.

3. **Existence of Invariant Operations**: The while loop must contain operations that are invariant, meaning their outputs do not depend on variables that change value in different iterations of the loop. Typically, these are operations whose inputs are loop-invariant or derived from other loop-invariant operations.

4. **Expensive Operations**: Among the invariant operations, those that are considered computationally expensive or resource-intensive are candidates for being hoisted out of the loop. This is inferred from the operation’s compute characteristics and the relative size of its outputs to its inputs (i.e., operations where the output size does not significantly exceed the input size).

5. **Absence of Side Effects or Control Dependencies**: The operations suitable for hoisting should not have side effects (like I/O operations) and should not be involved in control dependency relationships within the loop.

6. **Non-Blocking by Other Operations**: The operation should not be blocked by other operations that cannot be hoisted. Essentially, an operation can be hoisted if all its operand operations are also loop-invariant or already hoisted.

Here's an illustrative example of a TensorFlow model with a while loop that might trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Condition for the while loop to continue running
def condition(x):
    return tf.less(x[0], 10)

# Body of the while loop
def body(x):
    a = x[1] * 5  # Invariant operation
    b = tf.exp(a)  # Expensive and invariant operation
    return x[0] + 1, b

# Loop variables (tuple)
loop_vars = (0, 2.0)

# Construct the while loop in TensorFlow
result = tf.while_loop(condition, body, loop_vars)

# This setup has a tuple-shaped state, and includes invariant and potentially expensive operations
```

In this example, the multiplication and the exponential operations within the loop body are invariant with respect to the loop variable `x[0]` and could potentially be hoisted out if they meet all other conditions specified by the optimization pass.
