The model should contain a while loop where certain instructions within the loop body are invariant, meaning they produce the same result in every iteration of the loop. These invariant instructions should be computationally expensive and not have side effects. 

The optimization pass `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` is triggered when these conditions are met. It attempts to hoist these invariant instructions out of the loop body, executing them only once before the loop starts, rather than in every iteration. This can significantly improve the performance of the model if the loop has a high trip count.

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization:

```python
def condition(x):
    return tf.reduce_sum(x) < 1000

def body(x):
    expensive_op = tf.matmul(x, x)  # Invariant and expensive operation
    return expensive_op + x

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
result = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [x])
```

In this example, the matrix multiplication `tf.matmul(x, x)` is an expensive operation that produces the same result in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, the `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` optimization pass would be triggered to hoist this operation out of the loop body.
