### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `TopkRewriter` in TensorFlow XLA include:

1. **Presence of a `Sort` operation with one or two operands:** The model must contain a `Sort` operation. If it has two operands, the second must be an iota generated along the sorting dimension.

2. **Use of a `Sort` operation in a Top-K context:** The `Sort` operation should be followed by a `Slice` operation that extracts the first `k` elements along the sorting dimension. This pattern is indicative of performing a Top-K operation where only the top `k` values (and possibly their indices) are required.

3. **Non-strided, non-zero starting `Slice`:** The `Slice` operation must start at index 0 for the sort dimension and have a stride of 1, ensuring it's simply truncating the sorted list to the top `k` elements.

4. **Matching comparator for handling NaN values safely:** The comparator used in the `Sort` operation should handle NaN values correctly to ensure stability in sorting.

5. **Data types and dimensions alignment:** The `Sort` operation's data type must be either floating-point types (`F32`, `BF16`) or it must efficiently handle integer types through bit manipulations to ensure the comparator logic applies correctly. The sorting must be performed on either the first or the last dimension of the tensor.

Here is an example pattern in TensorFlow (Python) that would likely trigger this optimization when compiled with XLA:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate some data
data = tf.random.uniform([32, 100], minval=-1.0, maxval=1.0)

# Perform a top-5 sort
values, indices = tf.math.top_k(data, k=5, sorted=True)

# Model execution
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run([values, indices])
```

In this example, the `tf.math.top_k` is typically implemented under the hood using a sort followed by a slice. If XLA is enabled, and the conditions above are met, the `TopkRewriter` optimization might be applied to convert this into a more efficient custom TopK operation.
