### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `TopkRewriter` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The `TopkRewriter` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered for TensorFlow models containing a `Sort` operation that can be specialized to a `TopK` operation. This optimization is applicable under certain conditions, primarily when the `Sort` operation is used in a manner consistent with extracting the top `k` elements along a specified dimension. The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization include:

1. **Sort Operation with Specific Usage Patterns:** The optimization is triggered when a `Sort` operation is followed by a `Slice` operation that extracts the first `k` elements along the sorted dimension. This pattern typically indicates an intent to retrieve the top `k` elements.

2. **Dimension and Shape Constraints:**
   - The sort must be performed along either the first or the last dimension of the tensor.
   - The output of the sort is sliced such that only the first `k` elements of the sorted dimension are used, and the slice starts at 0 with a stride of 1.

3. **Data Types:** The data types supported for this optimization are typically floating-point types like `F32` or `BF16`. 

4. **Comparator Function:** The comparator used in the sort operation should be capable of handling NaN values correctly, ensuring that the comparison logic matches the expected behavior for floating-point numbers, including handling of negative zero and NaN.

5. **Usage of Iota:** For sorts involving two operands, the second operand should be an `Iota` operation, which often indicates the generation of indices used in sorting operations.

### Example Model Code:

For a TensorFlow model to trigger this optimization, it might look something like the following hypothetical TensorFlow code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input data
data = tf.random.normal([batch_size, num_elements])

# Perform a sort along the last dimension
sorted_data = tf.sort(data, axis=-1, direction='DESCENDING')

# Extract the top k elements
top_k = sorted_data[..., :k]
```

In this example:
- `tf.sort` is analogous to the `Sort` operation in XLA.
- The slicing `[..., :k]` represents the `Slice` operation that extracts the top `k` elements.

If the `Sort` operation in a model follows such a pattern, where it is primarily used to extract a subset of sorted elements, the `TopkRewriter` optimization can be triggered to potentially convert these operations into a more efficient `TopK` operation using a custom call in XLA.
