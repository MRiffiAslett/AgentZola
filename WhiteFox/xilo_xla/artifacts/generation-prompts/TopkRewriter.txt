### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model Triggering `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization

The TensorFlow model characteristics that trigger the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization in XLA must include a sequence where a tensor undergoes two consecutive reshape operations such that the final output shape of the second reshape matches the original shape of the tensor before the first reshape. This scenario implies that the second reshape operation effectively reverses the transformation applied by the first reshape, making the overall operation redundant.

#### Code Pattern Example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor of arbitrary shape
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[8, 16])

# First reshape transforms the shape
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [2, 64])

# Second reshape reverts to the original shape
output_tensor = tf.reshape(reshaped_tensor, [8, 16])
```

In this example, `output_tensor` will have the same shape as `input_tensor`, triggering the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization if used in a TensorFlow model compiled with XLA.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model Triggering `TopkRewriter` Optimization

The `TopkRewriter` optimization is triggered when there is a sort operation in the TensorFlow model that can be effectively replaced with a more efficient Top-K operation. This optimization is specifically applicable under conditions where the sort operation is followed by a slice that extracts the top K elements, the sorting comparison is nan-safe, and certain other conditions about the data layout and operation characteristics are met.

#### Code Pattern Example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform([10, 20], minval=1, maxval=100, dtype=tf.float32)

# Using TensorFlow operations to mimic a sort followed by a slice to retrieve top K elements
values, indices = tf.math.top_k(input_tensor, k=5, sorted=True)
```

In this example, the `tf.math.top_k` is directly representative of what the `TopkRewriter` seeks to optimize. However, if not using `tf.math.top_k` directly, a similar effect could be achieved by explicitly sorting and then slicing the tensor, which the XLA compiler would recognize and potentially optimize by converting it back into a `top_k` operation internally.

These optimizations significantly enhance performance by reducing unnecessary computations and utilizing more efficient algorithms suited for the operations' intents.
