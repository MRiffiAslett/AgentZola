The model should contain a `tf.linalg.batch_matmul` operation (or any operation that can be lowered to a batched dot product in XLA) where:

1. The batch dimensions of the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) tensors are equal and strictly ascending. This means that the batch dimensions are in the order of [0, 1, 2, ..., n] where n is the rank of the tensor minus 2 (the last two dimensions are usually the matrix dimensions in a batched matmul operation).

2. The operation has exactly one contracting dimension. In a matrix multiplication, the contracting dimension is usually the last dimension of the lhs tensor and the second-to-last dimension of the rhs tensor.

3. There exists at least one batch dimension in the lhs tensor that is degenerate, i.e., its size is 1.

Here is an example of such a model:

```python
# Assume input1 and input2 are 4D tensors with shapes [1, m, n, p] and [1, n, p, q] respectively.
# The batch dimensions are [0, 1, 2] which are equal and strictly ascending.
# The contracting dimension is [2] for lhs and [1] for rhs.
# The first batch dimension (dimension 0) is degenerate (size is 1).
output = tf.linalg.batch_matmul(input1, input2)
```

In this case, the `BatchDotSimplification` optimization pass will be triggered and the degenerate batch dimension will be elided from the batch dot operation.
