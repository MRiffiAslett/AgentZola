Generate a valid TensorFlow model for BatchDotSimplification that meets the requirements.

The `BatchDotSimplification` optimization in TensorFlow XLA targets specific characteristics and patterns within a TensorFlow model's batch dot operations. This optimization is triggered when the following conditions are met in a model's batch dot operation:

1. **Batch Dimensions Match and Are Ascending**: The batch dimensions of the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the dot operation must be identical and in strictly ascending order. This means that if the batch dimensions are represented as an array, the values should be consecutive integers starting from zero. For example, valid batch dimensions could be `[0, 1, 2]`.

2. **Single Contracting Dimension**: The dot operation must have exactly one contracting dimension. This is a common scenario in operations like matrix multiplication where two matrices are multiplied along one dimension.

3. **Presence of Degenerate Dimensions**: There must be at least one batch dimension in the LHS (and consequently in the RHS due to the matching requirement) where the size of the dimension is 1. These are called degenerate dimensions. A dimension is degenerate if its size does not contribute to the overall tensor's data volume, essentially being a singleton dimension that can be removed without losing information.

Here's a simple TensorFlow model code snippet that aligns with these characteristics and would likely trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a TensorFlow model with batch dot operation
# Assume the tensors are created with degenerate batch dimensions.
# tensor_a shape: [1, 10, 5], tensor_b shape: [1, 5, 15]
# Notice the '1' in the first dimension which is a degenerate batch dimension.

tensor_a = tf.random.normal([1, 10, 5])
tensor_b = tf.random.normal([1, 5, 15])

# Perform batch dot operation
# Since there's only one contracting dimension (last dimension of tensor_a and second last dimension of tensor_b)
# and the batch dimension is degenerate ([0] with dimension size 1),
# this setup meets all the criteria mentioned for optimization.
result = tf.linalg.matmul(tensor_a, tensor_b)

print(result.shape)  # Expected shape after batch matmul: [1, 10, 15]
```

In this scenario:

- The batch dimensions are `[0]` for both tensors, matching and strictly ascending.
- There is a single contracting dimension (dimension 2 of `tensor_a` and dimension 1 of `tensor_b`).
- The first dimension has size 1, making it a degenerate dimension.

Meeting these conditions suggests that the `BatchDotSimplification` optimization would be applied, simplifying the operation by potentially removing the unnecessary singleton batch dimension and optimizing the computation.
