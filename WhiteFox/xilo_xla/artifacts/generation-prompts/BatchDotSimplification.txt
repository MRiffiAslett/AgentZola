### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization

For the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` to be triggered, the TensorFlow model must exhibit a specific pattern of reshape operations. Specifically, the model should contain a sequence where a tensor is reshaped twice consecutively, and the final shape of the tensor after the second reshape operation is the same as the original shape of the tensor before the first reshape operation.

In TensorFlow code, this pattern can be represented as:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal([10, 20])
# First reshape: Change the shape of the tensor
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [200])
# Second reshape: Restore the original shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [10, 20])
```

In this example, `input_tensor` is reshaped to a new shape `[200]` and then reshaped back to the original shape `[10, 20]`. This model characteristic triggers the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model for `BatchDotSimplification` Optimization

The optimization pass `BatchDotSimplification` is triggered when a TensorFlow model involves a batch dot product operation (`tf.linalg.matmul` or equivalent in XLA) where the batch dimensions are degenerate (i.e., have a size of one) and the batch dimensions of both operands are equal and strictly ascending. The operation must also have exactly one contracting dimension.

In TensorFlow code, this pattern can be represented as:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create tensors with a degenerate batch dimension (size 1 in the batch dimension)
a = tf.random.normal([1, 5, 3])
b = tf.random.normal([1, 3, 4])

# Perform batch matrix multiplication
result = tf.linalg.matmul(a, b)
```

In this scenario, both tensors `a` and `b` have a batch dimension of size 1 (`[1, ...]`), and there is one contracting dimension (size 3 in the middle of both tensors). This specific structure will trigger the `BatchDotSimplification` optimization if these tensors are used within a model that is compiled with XLA where such optimizations are applicable.
