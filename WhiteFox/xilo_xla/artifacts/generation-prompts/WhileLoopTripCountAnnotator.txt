### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered for TensorFlow models that contain while loops with certain characteristics. These characteristics are primarily related to the loop's induction variable and its range. Here are the details:

1. **Presence of a While Loop**:
   The optimization targets HLO (High-Level Optimizer) instructions specifically with the opcode `kWhile`. This means the TensorFlow model must contain at least one while loop.

2. **Identifiable Induction Variable**:
   The loop must have an identifiable induction variable. This variable is typically used to control the number of iterations of the loop. The optimization pass attempts to extract the index of the tuple that represents this induction variable. If the loop does not use a clear induction variable or if it cannot be identified, this optimization will not be triggered.

3. **Trivial Loop Range**:
   If the induction variable and its range can be trivially analyzed (i.e., the bounds and step of the loop are straightforward to determine), the optimization is more likely to be applied. Specifically, the loop must have:
   - A bounded range (`min` and `max` values are defined and computable).
   - A known step value (the increment by which the induction variable changes in each iteration).
   - All values (`min`, `max`, `step`) must fit within the signed integer range, and `step` must be positive.

4. **Computable Trip Count**:
   If the loop range and step are known, the trip count (total number of iterations the loop will run) is computed as `(max - min) / step + 1`. This calculation must be feasible with the provided loop bounds and step.

5. **Fallback to Compute Trip Count**:
   If the loop is not trivial but still has a structure that allows for computation of a trip count through potentially more complex means (not explicitly defined in the provided code), the optimization might still be applied.

### Example Model

Here’s an example TensorFlow model with a simple loop structure that would likely trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

i = tf.constant(0)
max_val = tf.constant(100)
step_val = tf.constant(1)

def condition(i):
    return tf.less(i, max_val)

def body(i):
    return [tf.add(i, step_val)]

result = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [i])
```

In this model:
- The loop has a clear induction variable `i`.
- The loop iterates from `0` to `100` with a step of `1`.
- The loop bounds (`0` and `100`) and the step (`1`) are simple and fit within the signed integer range.
  
These characteristics match the criteria likely to trigger the `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA.
