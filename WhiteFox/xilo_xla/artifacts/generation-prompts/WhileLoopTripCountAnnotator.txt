### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of a TensorFlow Model That Triggers `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` in TensorFlow XLA

The TensorFlow model must contain a `while` loop that meets specific criteria for the `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` optimization pass to be triggered in TensorFlow XLA:

1. **Presence of a While Loop Instruction:**
   The model must explicitly include a while loop, represented by an HloInstruction with the opcode `kWhile`.

2. **Identifiable Induction Variable:**
   The while loop must have a detectable loop induction variable. This requires the model's loop structure to maintain an induction variable that can be identified through analysis, such as a typical for-loop counter.

3. **Computable Trip Count:**
   - **Trivial Loop with Bounded Range and Known Step:**
     If the loop is trivial (simple loop structure), it should have a bounded range and a known step size. The conditions include:
       - The loop's maximum and minimum bounds are non-negative.
       - The loop increment (step) is positive.
       - The loop trip count can be computed using the formula `(max - min) / step + 1`.
   - **Non-trivial Loop with Computable Trip Count:**
     For more complex loops, there should still be a mechanism to compute the trip count, perhaps through more sophisticated static analysis techniques or estimations.

### Illustrative Example

Here’s an example TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume `n` is a scalar tensor that defines the number of iterations
n = tf.constant(10)

def cond(i, max_iter):
    return tf.less(i, max_iter)

def body(i, max_iter):
    return (tf.add(i, 1), max_iter)

# TensorFlow while loop; corresponds to HloOpcode::kWhile in XLA
result = tf.while_loop(cond, body, [0, n])

# This simple loop has a clear induction variable (i), a known step size (1),
# and a bounded range (0 to n). It's a trivial loop where the trip count
# can be directly computed.
```

This simple model contains a while loop with straightforward characteristics suitable for the `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` optimization pass, leading to potential simplifications in the XLA compiled output.
