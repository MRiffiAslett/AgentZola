The model should contain a `while` loop operation. The `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` optimization pass is triggered when the model has a `while` loop where the trip count (the number of iterations the loop will execute) can be determined. 

The trip count can be determined in two ways:

1. The loop is a trivial loop where the range (max, min, step) is known. A trivial loop is a loop where the loop variable is incremented or decremented by a constant value in each iteration and the loop condition is a comparison of the loop variable with a constant. In this case, the trip count is calculated as `(max - min) / step + 1`.

2. If the loop is not a trivial loop, the trip count might still be computed by brute force. 

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization pass:

```python
i = tf.constant(0)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i, 10)
b = lambda i: tf.add(i, 1)
r = tf.while_loop(c, b, [i])
```

In this example, the `while` loop will execute 10 times, so the trip count is 10.
