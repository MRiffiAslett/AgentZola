The model should contain a `CustomCall` operation with a target that matches one of the following:

- "Sharding"
- "SPMDShardToFullShape"
- "SPMDFullToShardShape"
- "ShardingGroupCustomCallTargetName"
- "PropagationBarrierCustomCallTargetName"
- "FuncResultShardingTargetName"
- "ShardBarrierFrom"
- "ShardBarrierTo"

These operations are used for sharding in distributed TensorFlow. The `ShardingRemover` optimization pass is triggered when these operations are found in the model. The pass replaces these operations with their operands, effectively removing the sharding operations from the model. 

For example, if the model contains the following pattern:

```python
t1 = tf.raw_ops.CustomCall(input=input_tensor, custom_call_target="Sharding")
```

The `ShardingRemover` optimization pass will replace `t1` with `input_tensor`, removing the sharding operation.
