The model should contain the following pattern:

```
t1 = tf.cast(input_tensor, tf.bfloat16)
t2 = tf.some_operation(t1)
t3 = tf.cast(t2, tf.float32)
```

The pattern describes that there is a cast operation from `float32` to `bfloat16` on the input tensor, followed by some operation, and then a cast operation from `bfloat16` back to `float32`. The operation in the middle should be one that supports mixed precision, meaning it can accept `bfloat16` and `float32` inputs and produce `bfloat16` and `float32` outputs. 

The optimization pass `Bfloat16ConversionFolding` is triggered when all users of the operation are conversions from `float32` to `bfloat16` and the operation supports low precision output. The optimization pass is also triggered when the operation has a `bfloat16` to `float32` conversion as input and supports low precision operand. 

The optimization pass folds the conversions into the operation itself, meaning it changes the operation to directly produce or consume `bfloat16` data, eliminating the need for the conversions. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be converted.
