Generate a valid TensorFlow model for HloDce that meets the requirements.

The `HloDCE` (Dead Code Elimination) optimization in TensorFlow XLA targets TensorFlow models that contain specific characteristics of redundant or unused operations. The primary triggers for this optimization include:

1. **Unused Operations:** If an operation in the model does not contribute to the final output or its outputs are not used by any other operation, it becomes a candidate for elimination. For instance, operations that compute values but are never used in subsequent computations or the output.

2. **Dead Roots:** Operations that are roots (i.e., final operations in a computation chain) and are unused or do not have side effects can be removed.

3. **Unused Parameters:** Parameters that are not utilized within their computations can also be removed, particularly in the entry computation of the model.

4. **Redundant Fusion Outputs:** If a fusion operation (a single operation representing a subgraph of operations that are fused together) produces outputs that are not used by any operation, these outputs can be removed.

An example TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization might look like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Construct a simple model
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y = tf.constant([-1.0, -2.0, -3.0])
z = x + y  # z is never used
w = x - y  # w is used as the output

# Function that only uses w
@tf.function
def model():
    return w

# Run the model
print(model())
```

In the above example, the operation `z = x + y` is dead code because `z` is computed but never used in the computation that leads to the model's output. An optimization pass like `HloDCE` would identify `z` as removable, thus simplifying the computation and potentially improving performance.

By identifying and removing such dead code and redundant operations, the TensorFlow XLA compiler can optimize the execution graph, reduce resource usage, and improve execution speed.
