The TensorFlow model triggers the optimization pass `HloDce` in TensorFlow XLA when it contains dead code, i.e., instructions that are not contributing to the final output of the model. This includes:

1. Dead roots: Instructions that are not used by any other instruction and do not contribute to the final output of the computation.

2. Dead parameters: Parameters that are not used by any instruction in the computation.

3. Unused outputs of multi-output fusion instructions: If a fusion instruction produces multiple outputs and some of them are not used by any other instruction, these unused outputs trigger the `HloDce` optimization.

4. Dangling computations: Computations that are not called by any instruction in the module.

The model should contain these patterns to reach the `return changed;` line in function `HloDCE::Run`, leading the function to return true. The `changed` variable is set to true when any dead code is detected and removed from the model.
