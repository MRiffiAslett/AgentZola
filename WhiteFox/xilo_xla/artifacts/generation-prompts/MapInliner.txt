### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Characteristics of TensorFlow model to trigger `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization:

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains two consecutive `tf.reshape` operations where the second reshape operation reverts the tensor to its original shape before the first reshape. This optimization checks if the output shape of the second reshape matches the input shape of the tensor input to the first reshape. If they match, the optimization simplifies the model by removing both reshape operations, effectively forwarding the original tensor.

#### Example TensorFlow code pattern:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([8, 8])

# First reshape operation changing the shape
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [64])

# Second reshape operation reverting to the original shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 8])
```
In this example, `t2` would be optimized out to directly reference `input_tensor`.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow model to trigger `MapInliner` optimization:

The `MapInliner` optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model uses the `tf.map_fn` function where the function applied in `map_fn` is simple enough to be inlined - specifically, if the function consists of operations that use only the parameters (no intermediate computations that depend on external states or constants). The transformation will inline the operation, replacing the `map_fn` with the operation itself applied element-wise across the input.

#### Example TensorFlow code pattern:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([10, 5])

# Simple function to be applied using map_fn
def simple_op(x):
    return x * 2  # This operation directly uses the input parameter x

# Using map_fn to apply the simple_op element-wise
result = tf.map_fn(simple_op, input_tensor)
```
In this scenario, if `simple_op` is simple enough (like just multiplying by 2 in this example), the `MapInliner` might replace the `map_fn` with a direct element-wise multiplication operation across `input_tensor`, optimizing away the overhead of `map_fn`.

These examples illustrate cases where these specific optimizations would be triggered in TensorFlow models using the XLA compiler.
