The model should contain a `tf.map_fn` operation where the function applied to each element of the input tensor is a simple operation that only involves the input parameters. 

The pattern describes that there is a `map` operation in the model. The function applied to each element of the input tensor(s) must be a simple operation that only involves the input parameters. This means that the function does not contain any complex computations or calls to other functions. 

The function applied to each element of the input tensor(s) can be a `tf.constant` operation, a `tf.parameter` operation, or any other operation that only involves the input parameters. 

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that would trigger the `MapInliner` optimization pass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple function that only involves the input parameters
def simple_fn(x):
    return x * 2

# Apply the function to each element of the input tensor using tf.map_fn
input_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
output_tensor = tf.map_fn(simple_fn, input_tensor)
```

In this example, the `simple_fn` function is a simple operation that only involves the input parameters. Therefore, the `MapInliner` optimization pass would be triggered when this model is compiled with TensorFlow XLA.
