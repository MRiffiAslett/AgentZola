### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### ReshapeReshapeForwarding Trigger Characteristics

The TensorFlow XLA optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` is triggered when a model contains a specific pattern of reshape operations. The conditions that need to be met are:

1. **Two Consecutive Reshape Operations**: The model must have an instance where a tensor is reshaped twice consecutively. 

2. **Shape Reversal**: The output shape of the second reshape operation must exactly match the shape of the tensor before the first reshape operation.

This optimization essentially looks for redundant reshape operations that transform a tensor shape to another shape and then back to the original shape. This is a common scenario when models are automatically generated or modified, leading to unnecessary computational steps.

#### Example Code
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform([8, 8])

# First reshape changes the shape
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [64])

# Second reshape reverts to the original shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 8])
```
In this example, `t2` would be optimized to directly reference `input_tensor`, skipping the intermediate reshapes.

### Defuser Trigger Characteristics

The TensorFlow XLA optimization pass `Defuser` triggers when:

1. **Presence of Fusion Computations**: The model must contain fusion computations. Fusion in TensorFlow XLA refers to combining multiple operations into a single, more efficient operation. However, there are cases where these fused operations need to be separated or 'defused' back into individual operations for reasons such as debugging, changing hardware constraints, or other optimizations that might benefit from a different operations arrangement.

2. **Single Caller Requirement**: Each fusion computation must be called from exactly one other instruction. This is typical in scenarios where operations are fused automatically by XLA but subsequently need adjustment for efficiency or hardware compatibility.

#### Example Code
Here’s a conceptual example, as the actual handling of fusion is typically managed internally by TensorFlow and not exposed directly to users in Python:

```python
# Hypothetical example, as direct manipulation of fusion is not typically exposed in TensorFlow's Python API
# Assume 'comp' is a previously defined computation that has been fused and is used in exactly one other computation

# In actual TensorFlow XLA usage, this would be part of the optimization passes where the system:
# - Identifies a fused computation 'comp' being used by exactly one other computation
# - Decides to defuse 'comp' for any reason such as the ones mentioned above
```
In this scenario, if `comp` meets the criteria, it would be defused by the `Defuser` optimization pass, separating the previously fused operations.
