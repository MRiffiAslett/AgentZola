### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model Triggering `ReshapeReshapeForwarding`

For the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization to be triggered, the TensorFlow model must have a specific sequence of reshape operations. Specifically, the model should include:

1. An initial tensor, `input_tensor`.
2. A first reshape operation that transforms `input_tensor` to a new shape.
3. A second reshape operation that reverts the tensor back to the original shape of `input_tensor`.

This pattern is described by the following TensorFlow code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform([8, 8])

# First reshape operation (any arbitrary new shape)
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [64])

# Second reshape operation that reverts to the original shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 8])
```

In this model, `t2` should have the exact same shape as `input_tensor`. The pattern effectively negates the first reshape, making the sequence eligible for optimization by removing the redundant reshapes.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model Triggering `ReduceScatterReassociate`

For the `ReduceScatterReassociate` optimization to be triggered, the TensorFlow model must involve specific characteristics related to the placement and configuration of `ReduceScatter` operations. The model should include:

1. Two consecutive `ReduceScatter` operations, where each operation is directly connected to another without intermediate operations influencing their output.
2. These `ReduceScatter` operations must be compatible in terms of:
   - Having the same reduction operation (e.g., sum, max).
   - Targeting the same scatter dimension.
   - Using the same `AllReduceKey` properties, ensuring they are in the same collective communication domain.

Additionally, these operations should not have constraints on their layout and must not be part of a complex scheduling group or have multiple users, which might affect their eligibility for reassociation.

Here’s a simplified conceptual example to illustrate the pattern:

```python
# This is a hypothetical abstraction as TensorFlow does not directly expose
# ReduceScatter in Python API. This is to illustrate the pattern.

import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholder for collective operations
def reduce_scatter_sum(input_tensor, scatter_dim):
    return tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor, axis=scatter_dim)  # Simplified abstraction

# Input tensors
x = tf.random.uniform([8, 8])
y = tf.random.uniform([8, 8])

# First and second ReduceScatter operations
rs1 = reduce_scatter_sum(x, scatter_dim=1)
rs2 = reduce_scatter_sum(y, scatter_dim=1)

# An operation combining outputs of both ReduceScatters
result = rs1 + rs2  # This pattern could be optimized to a single ReduceScatter if conditions are met
```

In practice, these optimizations would be handled at a lower level within the TensorFlow XLA compiler, and such direct manipulations may not be evident at the TensorFlow Python API level. The key is that the `ReduceScatter` operations are set up in a way that they can be combined into a single, more efficient operation.
