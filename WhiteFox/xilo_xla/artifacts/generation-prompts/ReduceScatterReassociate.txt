The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter(input_tensor1, ...)
t2 = tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter(input_tensor2, ...)
t3 = tf.some_reduction_op(t1, t2)
```
The pattern describes that there are two `ReduceScatter` operations in the model, followed by a reduction operation that takes the outputs of the `ReduceScatter` operations as inputs. The `ReduceScatter` operations must be compatible, meaning they belong to the same domain, have the same reduction kind, and scatter along the same dimension. 

The reduction operation can be any operation that matches the `MatchReductionInstruction` function, such as `tf.add`, `tf.multiply`, `tf.minimum`, `tf.maximum`, etc. 

The `ReduceScatter` operations must have exactly one user, and if they have scheduling annotations, the annotations must be the same. 

The model should not contain any `ReduceScatter` operations with constrained layouts.
