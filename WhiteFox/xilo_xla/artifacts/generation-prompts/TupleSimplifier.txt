### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Characteristics of TensorFlow models triggering `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains a sequence where a tensor is reshaped twice consecutively, and the final shape of the tensor after the second reshape operation matches its original shape prior to the first reshape operation. This pattern effectively makes the reshape operations redundant, as the tensor's final shape is identical to its initial shape.

#### Example Model Pattern:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming input_tensor is a predefined tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([8, 8])

# First reshape operation changing the shape of input_tensor
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [64])

# Second reshape operation that reverts t1 to the original shape of input_tensor
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 8])
```
In this model, `t1` is reshaped to `[64]`, and then `t2` reshapes it back to `[8, 8]`, which is the original shape of `input_tensor`. This scenario triggers the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass, where the redundant reshapes will be identified and optimized away, effectively simplifying the model by removing unnecessary operations.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow models triggering `TupleSimplifier` optimization

The `TupleSimplifier` optimization is triggered in a TensorFlow XLA model when it contains tuples that are immediately decomposed back into their original constituent elements without any modifications. This scenario typically involves a tuple being created and then immediately followed by a series of `GetTupleElement` (GTE) operations that extract each element of the tuple in the same order as they were combined. If the shape and the constituents of the tuple and the resultant operations match perfectly, the tuple and the GTE operations are redundant and can be optimized out.

#### Example Model Pattern:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming op1, op2, ... opN are predefined operations producing tensors
op1 = tf.random.normal([2, 2])
op2 = tf.random.normal([2, 2])

# Creating a tuple from multiple operations
tuple_op = (op1, op2)

# Immediately decomposing the tuple
elem1 = tuple_op[0]
elem2 = tuple_op[1]
```
In this model structure, `tuple_op` is created to combine `op1` and `op2`, and immediately afterward, `elem1` and `elem2` extract the original tensors from `tuple_op`. If this pattern is detected where the extraction order and the original tensors' structure are preserved, the `TupleSimplifier` optimization is triggered, removing the unnecessary tuple creation and decomposition, thereby simplifying the computational graph.
