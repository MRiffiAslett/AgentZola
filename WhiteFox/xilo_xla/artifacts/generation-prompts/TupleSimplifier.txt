### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass triggers when specific conditions in the TensorFlow model are met. The model must have a sequence where a tensor undergoes two consecutive reshape operations such that the final shape of the tensor after these operations is identical to its original shape.

A TensorFlow model that would trigger this optimization typically involves:

1. An initial tensor with any arbitrary shape.
2. A first reshape operation that transforms this tensor to a new shape.
3. A second reshape operation applied on the result of the first reshape, which reverts it back to the original shape of the tensor.

Here’s an illustrative code example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example input tensor of shape (4, 4)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([4, 4])

# First reshape operation changes the shape
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [16])

# Second reshape operation reverts to the original shape
reverted_tensor = tf.reshape(reshaped_tensor, [4, 4])
```

In this example, the `input_tensor` first gets reshaped to `[16]` and then is reshaped back to `[4, 4]`. This pattern is a direct match for the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` pass, which will simplify this by removing the redundant reshapes.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Model for `TupleSimplifier` Optimization

The `TupleSimplifier` optimization pass is triggered under specific structural conditions in a TensorFlow model that uses tuple and GetTupleElement (GTE) operations in a way that the entire tuple assembly and disassembly can be simplified.

Key characteristics for a model to trigger this optimization include:

1. A tuple is constructed using a series of operations.
2. Each element of the tuple is extracted using GTE operations.
3. The GTEs strictly extract elements in a manner where each element corresponds to the original operations that were used to form the tuple.

Here's an illustrative code example using HLO (High-Level Optimizer) concepts, as the actual TensorFlow Python API does not directly expose tuple and GTE operations:

```python
# Hypothetical HLO-like pseudocode
op1 = ...  # Some operation
op2 = ...  # Some operation
tuple = create_tuple(op1, op2)  # Tuple operation combining op1 and op2
gte1 = get_tuple_element(tuple, index=0)  # Extracting first element
gte2 = get_tuple_element(tuple, index=1)  # Extracting second element

# Further operations using gte1 and gte2
```

In this scenario, if `gte1` and `gte2` are the only uses of `tuple` and they extract the elements directly placed into the tuple, the entire sequence of creating and then extracting from the tuple can be simplified, removing unnecessary operations.

These models illustrate scenarios where the respective optimizations would be applied to simplify the computation graph by removing redundant operations or structures.
