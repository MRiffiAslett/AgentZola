The model should contain the following patterns:

1. A pattern where a tuple is created from the elements of another tuple, and the elements are accessed in the same order as they are in the original tuple. This pattern can be represented as:

```python
t1 = tf.tuple([input_tensor1, input_tensor2, ...])
t2 = tf.tuple([tf.gather(t1, 0), tf.gather(t1, 1), ...])
```

In this case, `t2` is a redundant tuple and can be replaced with `t1`.

2. A pattern where a chain of `GetTupleElement` (GTE) operations is performed on a tuple, and the final GTE operation is used elsewhere in the model. This pattern can be represented as:

```python
t1 = tf.tuple([input_tensor1, input_tensor2, ...])
gte1 = tf.gather(t1, index1)
gte2 = tf.gather(gte1, index2)
...
```

In this case, the chain of GTE operations can be replaced with a single operation that directly accesses the required element from the original tuple.
