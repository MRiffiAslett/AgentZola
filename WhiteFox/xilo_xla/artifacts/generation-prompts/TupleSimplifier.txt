Generate a valid TensorFlow model for TupleSimplifier that meets the requirements.

The `TupleSimplifier` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by specific characteristics in TensorFlow models that involve redundant tuple operations. Here are the key characteristics that can trigger this optimization:

1. **Use of Tuple and GetTupleElement (GTE) Instructions**:
   - This optimization is specifically concerned with models where `Tuple` instructions are followed by `GetTupleElement` operations. The optimization will be triggered if a `Tuple` can be completely represented by successive `GetTupleElement` operations referring back to the individual elements of another tuple (or the same) without altering the tuple structure.

2. **Structure and Index Alignment**:
   - The model must have a `Tuple` instruction where each element of the tuple is accessed sequentially by a `GetTupleElement` with indices that match their position in the tuple (i.e., the i-th element is fetched by a GTE with an index i). This pattern suggests that the original tuple is just a redundant re-packaging of another tuple.

3. **Shape Compatibility**:
   - For the tuple simplification to be triggered, the shape of the original tuple and the shape of the tuple referred to by the `GetTupleElement` operations must be compatible.

4. **Single Reference**:
   - The optimization can also trigger when a chain of `GetTupleElement` operations can directly replace the use of a tuple, effectively flattening the access pattern and potentially removing the need for the tuple altogether.

### Illustrative Example:

Consider a TensorFlow XLA model structured as follows:

```python
# Pseudocode representing TensorFlow operations
op = some_operation()  # Generates an output
tuple1 = tf.tuple([op, another_operation()])
gte1 = tuple1[0]  # Access first element, which is 'op'
gte2 = tuple1[1]  # Access second element

# Another example
tuple2 = tf.tuple([gte1, gte2])
output = tuple2[0]  # Here, output effectively becomes 'op'
```

In this example, `tuple2` is redundant because it is just another packaging of `tuple1` without any modification. The `TupleSimplifier` can detect such patterns and optimize by removing `tuple2` and directly using `gte1` and `gte2` as needed, or even further simplifying the access pattern if possible.

This simplification reduces the computational graph's complexity and potentially improves execution efficiency by cutting down unnecessary data repackaging.
