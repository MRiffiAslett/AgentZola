### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Model Characteristics for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization in TensorFlow XLA

This optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains two consecutive `reshape` operations where the output shape of the second reshape matches the input shape of the first reshape. Essentially, this indicates that the second reshape operation is reversing the transformation performed by the first reshape operation, making the overall transformation redundant.

#### Pattern:
1. **First Reshape**: Transforms an input tensor `input_tensor` from its original shape to any new shape. This can be any valid transformation as long as it is a legal reshape.
2. **Second Reshape**: Transforms the tensor back to the original shape of `input_tensor`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example of triggering the optimization
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([8, 2])
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [4, 4])  # First reshape to a new shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [8, 2])           # Second reshape back to the original shape

# t2 is equivalent to input_tensor after the optimization
```

In this scenario, after the optimization, the model will directly use `input_tensor` instead of going through two reshape operations, effectively simplifying the computational graph.

### Model Characteristics for `SortSimplifier` Optimization in TensorFlow XLA

This optimization targets sorting operations within TensorFlow models, particularly when the output of a sort operation is a tuple, and some elements of this tuple are unused in subsequent computations or in the output of the model.

#### Pattern:
1. **Sort Operation**: The model should include a sort operation where the result is a tuple of multiple sorted values or keys.
2. **Usage of Tuple Elements**: Not all elements of the tuple resulting from the sort operation are utilized in further operations or in the model's output. This can occur, for example, if only specific indices of the tuple are accessed using operations like `tf.gather`.

```python
# Example TensorFlow code that might trigger the optimization
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform([10, 2])
values, indices = tf.math.top_k(input_tensor, k=5, sorted=True)  # Sort operation creating a tuple

# Use only values for further computation
result = values + 10  # Further use only values, indices are unused
```

In this case, the optimization would potentially modify the sort operation to only compute and return the `values` since `indices` are not used in any subsequent operations, simplifying the computation and potentially improving memory usage and performance.

Both optimizations aim to simplify the computational graph by removing redundant operations or outputs, leading to more efficient execution of the model.
