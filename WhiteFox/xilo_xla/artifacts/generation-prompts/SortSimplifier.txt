The model should contain a `tf.sort` operation that has a tuple shape and has unused output values. The `tf.sort` operation should not be the root instruction of the computation. All users of the `tf.sort` operation should be `tf.get_tuple_element` operations. If all operands of the `tf.sort` operation are used, the optimization pass will not be triggered. 

Here is an example of a model that would trigger the `SortSimplifier` optimization pass:

```python
# Assume input_tensor is a 2D tensor
sorted_tensor, indices = tf.sort(input_tensor, axis=-1, direction='ASCENDING', name=None)
# Only use sorted_tensor in the following computation, indices is not used
output_tensor = tf.reduce_sum(sorted_tensor, axis=-1)
```

In this example, the `tf.sort` operation returns a tuple of `sorted_tensor` and `indices`, but `indices` is not used in the following computation. Therefore, the `SortSimplifier` optimization pass will be triggered to remove the unused output `indices` from the `tf.sort` operation.
