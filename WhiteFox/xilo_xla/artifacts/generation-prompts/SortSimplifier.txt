Generate a valid TensorFlow model for SortSimplifier that meets the requirements.

The `SortSimplifier` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by specific characteristics in TensorFlow models involving the `Sort` operation, particularly when it is used with tuple outputs. Here’s a breakdown of the characteristics that lead this optimization to be activated:

1. **Tuple Output of Sort Instruction**: The optimization is specifically designed to handle `Sort` operations that produce a tuple output. This is typical in scenarios where multiple arrays are sorted simultaneously, and the results are grouped into a tuple.

2. **Unused Tuple Elements**: The simplifier checks if all elements of the tuple output from the `Sort` operation are actually used later in the model. If any elements (or operands corresponding to those elements) are not used, the optimization considers these operands for removal. 

3. **Usage Restricted to Certain Operations**: For the optimization to be triggered, all uses of the tuple elements must be through `GetTupleElement` operations. If there are other kinds of operations using the tuple elements, the optimization does not proceed.

4. **Comparator Uses**: The optimization also inspects the comparator function used by the `Sort`. It checks which parameters of the comparator (representing the operands being sorted) are actually used. If a parameter (operand) is not used in the comparator logic, it’s considered redundant and eligible for removal.

5. **Preservation of Necessary Operands and Comparator Adjustments**: If it’s determined that some operands are unused, they are removed, and the sort operation’s shape and operands are adjusted accordingly. Similarly, the comparator function is modified to only include parameters that correspond to the remaining (used) operands.

### Example Model Pattern

Consider a TensorFlow model where a `Sort` operation outputs a tuple, but only one element of the tuple is used later in the model. For example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming `x`, `y`, and `z` are pre-defined tensors.
sorted_tuple = tf.raw_ops.Sort(input=[x, y, z], direction='ASCENDING')
useful_output = sorted_tuple[0]  # Only the first element is used.

# further operations using useful_output
```

In this scenario, if `y` and `z` are not used after sorting, the `SortSimplifier` can optimize the sort operation to only sort `x` and adjust the comparator accordingly.

This optimization is beneficial for reducing the computational overhead by minimizing the number of operations and the complexity of the operations performed, especially in large-scale models where sorting can be a significant bottleneck.
