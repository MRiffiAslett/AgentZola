The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.dynamic_slice(input_tensor, start_indices, slice_sizes)
t2 = tf.dynamic_update_slice(input_tensor, update, start_indices)
```
The pattern describes that there are `DynamicSlice` or `DynamicUpdateSlice` operators in the model. The `DynamicSlice` operator extracts a slice of a given size from a larger tensor at given start indices. The `DynamicUpdateSlice` operator updates a slice of a larger tensor at given start indices with a given update tensor.

The optimization pass `DynamicIndexSplitter` is triggered when the start indices for these operations are not scalar values. The optimization pass will split the start indices into individual scalar values for each dimension. 

The model will also trigger the optimization pass if the rank of the operand tensor for `DynamicSlice` or `DynamicUpdateSlice` is 0. In this case, the `DynamicSlice` or `DynamicUpdateSlice` operation will be replaced with the operand tensor itself (for `DynamicSlice`) or the update tensor (for `DynamicUpdateSlice`).
