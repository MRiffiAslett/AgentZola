Generate a valid TensorFlow model for ConvertAsyncCollectivesToSync that meets the requirements.

The TensorFlow XLA optimization pass `ConvertAsyncCollectivesToSync` is triggered for models that use asynchronous collective operations, but where such operations are not effectively overlapped with other independent operations in the execution schedule. This specific optimization aims to replace asynchronous collective operations, which are not overlapped by other operations, with their synchronous counterparts. This is typically beneficial for improving execution determinism and potentially reducing complexity in the runtime handling of these operations.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow Models to Trigger this Optimization:

1. **Use of Asynchronous Collective Operations**: The model must employ asynchronous collective operations such as `AllReduceStart`, `AllGatherStart`, or `CollectivePermuteStart`. These operations are typically used in distributed training scenarios where aggregation or communication across different processing units is required.

2. **Lack of Effective Overlapping in Execution Schedule**:
   - The asynchronous operations (`async_start`) are followed directly by their corresponding completion operations (`async_done`) in the execution schedule without any intervening independent operations that could effectively overlap with these collectives.
   - If any operations intervene between an `async_start` and an `async_done`, they must not be considered as NOPs (no-operation). NOPs are operations that do not have a significant computational load or side effects, thus not justifying the asynchronous operation setup.

### Code Illustration:

Suppose a TensorFlow model is structured as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholder for distributed TensorFlow setup
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    # Input data and model definition
    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

    # Example of an asynchronous all-reduce operation
    # This operation is simplified and may not directly reflect actual asynchronous collective usage
    sum_gradients = tf.raw_ops.AllReduce(input=model.trainable_variables, reduction='sum', communication_hint='nccl', timeout_seconds=120, async=True)
    # Corresponding completion of asynchronous operation
    completed_op = tf.raw_ops.AllReduceDone(input=sum_gradients, async=True)

    # Compile model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
```

In this example:
- The model uses asynchronous collective operations (`AllReduce` with `async=True`).
- If the actual execution does not involve other independent operations effectively overlapping with the `AllReduce` operation, and if the TensorFlow XLA compiler determines it based on the scheduling, then the `ConvertAsyncCollectivesToSync` optimization may convert these asynchronous operations into synchronous ones to streamline execution.
