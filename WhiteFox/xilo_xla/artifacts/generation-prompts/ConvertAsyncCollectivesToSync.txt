The model should contain the following pattern:

```
async_start = tf.xla.experimental.start_async_outbound_data_transfer(...)
async_done = tf.xla.experimental.done_async_outbound_data_transfer(async_start)
```

The pattern describes that there are asynchronous collective operations in the model. The `start_async_outbound_data_transfer` operator starts an asynchronous data transfer operation, and the `done_async_outbound_data_transfer` operator marks the completion of the asynchronous data transfer operation started by `async_start`.

The optimization pass `ConvertAsyncCollectivesToSync` is triggered when these asynchronous collective operations are not overlapped with other operations after scheduling, meaning that they are effectively synchronous. In this case, the optimization pass will convert these asynchronous collective operations to their synchronous counterparts to simplify the computation.
