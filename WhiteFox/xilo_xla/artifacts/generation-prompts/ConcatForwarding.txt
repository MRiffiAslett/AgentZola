### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ConcatForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain nested concatenation operations along the same dimension:
```
inner = tf.concat([a, b], axis=N)
result = tf.concat([inner, c], axis=N)
```
The optimization flattens the nested `tf.concat` calls into a single concatenation
`tf.concat([a, b, c], axis=N)`. The key requirement is that both the inner and outer
concatenation must operate along the same axis.
