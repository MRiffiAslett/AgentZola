The model should contain HLO instructions that generate zero-sized arrays. These instructions should not have side effects, should not be constants, and their shapes should be static and array-like. 

The model should also contain computations that are safely removable or parameters that do not have control dependencies and are not dead. 

Here is an example of such a pattern:

```python
# Assume `input_tensor` is a tensor with shape (0, 10, 10)
t1 = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor, axis=0)  # This will result in a zero-sized array
```

In this case, the `reduce_sum` operation will generate a zero-sized array because the first dimension of `input_tensor` is 0. This operation does not have side effects, is not a constant, and the shape of the output is static and array-like. Therefore, it will trigger the `ZeroSizedHloElimination` optimization pass.
