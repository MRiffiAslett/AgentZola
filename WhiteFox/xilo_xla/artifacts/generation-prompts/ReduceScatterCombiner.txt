Generate a valid TensorFlow model for ReduceScatterCombiner that meets the requirements.

The TensorFlow XLA `ReduceScatterCombiner` optimization pass is triggered for models that exhibit specific characteristics in their use of the `ReduceScatter` operation. Here are the key traits:

1. **Multiple ReduceScatter Operations**: The model should contain multiple `ReduceScatter` operations. The combiner optimization looks to merge multiple such operations into a single, more efficient operation. Therefore, models that utilize only a single `ReduceScatter` operation or do not use `ReduceScatter` at all will not trigger this optimization.

2. **Same Reduction Operation**: All `ReduceScatter` operations that are considered for combination must employ the same reduction operation (e.g., SUM, MAX). This is necessary because the combined operation will use a single reduction function applied across all inputs.

3. **Consistent Scatter Dimensions (if combining by dimension)**: If the `combine_by_dim_` is set to true, then the `ReduceScatter` operations need to have the same scatter dimension, or at least a scatter dimension that can be aligned through permutations. This ensures that the data is scattered correctly in the combined operation.

4. **Sufficient Size and Count**: The combined size of the tensors involved in the `ReduceScatter` operations should meet certain thresholds (`combine_threshold_in_bytes_` and `combine_threshold_count_`) to make the combination worthwhile. These thresholds help in deciding whether the overhead of combining operations is offset by the performance gain from reduced operation count and possibly more optimal memory access patterns.

5. **Non-constrained Layouts**: The optimization is skipped if any of the `ReduceScatter` operations have layout constraints. This is because combining operations with different layout constraints can lead to incorrect results or require complex and costly data rearrangements.

6. **Exclusion from While Loops**: If `combine_while_loops_` is false, then `ReduceScatter` operations that are part of a computation graph called within a `While` loop are not considered for combination. This is typically to avoid complications or inefficiencies arising from dynamic control flow.

### Example Model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a distributed TensorFlow setup with multiple devices
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(devices=["GPU:0", "GPU:1"])

with strategy.scope():
    # Input tensor
    input_tensor = tf.random.normal([4, 1024])

    # Multiple ReduceScatter operations with the same reduction operation and scatter dimension
    reduced_1 = tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter(input=input_tensor, reduction="sum", scatter_dim=1)
    reduced_2 = tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter(input=input_tensor, reduction="sum", scatter_dim=1)

    # The combined operation would replace reduced_1 and reduced_2 with a single ReduceScatter
```
In this example, because there are multiple `ReduceScatter` operations with the same reduction type and scatter dimension, and assuming the size and count thresholds are met, the `ReduceScatterCombiner` optimization would likely be triggered.
