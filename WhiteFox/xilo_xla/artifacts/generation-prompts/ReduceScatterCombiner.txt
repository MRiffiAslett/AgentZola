The model should contain multiple `tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter` operations that can be combined into a single `ReduceScatter` operation. The `ReduceScatter` operations must have the same reduction operation and exactly one operand. 

The `ReduceScatter` operation in TensorFlow is used to perform a reduction operation on a tensor and then scatter the result across devices. The operation takes a tensor, performs a reduction operation (such as sum, prod, max, min, etc.) along a specified dimension, and then scatters the reduced tensor across a list of devices.

The `ReduceScatterCombiner` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered when there are multiple `ReduceScatter` operations that can be combined into a single `ReduceScatter` operation. This can reduce the overhead of launching multiple operations and improve performance.

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that can trigger this optimization pass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume we have a tensor 'input_tensor' and a list of devices 'devices'

# Multiple ReduceScatter operations
reduced1 = tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter(input=input_tensor, reduction_op='sum', devices=devices)
reduced2 = tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter(input=input_tensor, reduction_op='sum', devices=devices)
```

In this example, the two `ReduceScatter` operations perform the same reduction operation ('sum') on the same input tensor and scatter the result across the same list of devices. Therefore, these two operations can be combined into a single `ReduceScatter` operation by the `ReduceScatterCombiner` optimization pass.
