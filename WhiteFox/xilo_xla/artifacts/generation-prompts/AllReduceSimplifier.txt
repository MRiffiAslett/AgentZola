### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of the TensorFlow Model for `AllReduceSimplifier` Optimization Pass in TensorFlow XLA

The `AllReduceSimplifier` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA triggers when specific conditions related to the structure and configuration of AllReduce operations in the model are met. Below are the characteristics of a TensorFlow model that would activate this optimization:

1. **AllReduce Operations with Single Participant Groups**: 
   - The optimization is triggered when an AllReduce operation involves only a single participant (device) in its replica group. This occurs when the size of each replica group is exactly one, suggesting that no actual reduction across multiple devices is necessary. Thus, the AllReduce operation can be simplified by replacing it with its input operand.

2. **AllReduce Operations with Replicated Input Across All Participants**:
   - If the input to the AllReduce operation is the same (replicated) across all participants, the operation can be optimized out. This is determined through a replication analysis that checks if the input is identical across all the required devices.

3. **Cross-Replica and Cross-Module AllReduce**:
   - The optimization targets AllReduce operations that are either cross-replica (involving data exchange across different replicas) or cross-module (involving data exchange across different modules of devices). The simplification conditions consider whether the operation spans across different replicas or modules.

4. **Element-wise Operations Inside AllReduce**:
   - For AllReduce operations that apply a specific function (like addition, minimum, maximum, etc.), if the operation involves an element-wise application that can be simplified based on the nature of the operation and the data involved, the AllReduce can be replaced. For example, an addition followed by multiplication by the number of participants can be simplified if the input is replicated.

5. **Configuration and Group Size Consistency**:
   - The model configuration, specifically whether SPMD (single program, multiple data) partitioning is used, affects whether certain optimizations can be applied. Additionally, the optimization checks for consistency in the participant group sizes across all groups involved in the AllReduce operation.

Here is an example pattern in TensorFlow (Python) that could potentially trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming `strategy` is some form of distributed strategy
@tf.function
def distributed_operation(tensor):
    # AllReduce operation where the input tensor is the same across all devices
    reduced_tensor = strategy.reduce("sum", tensor, axis=None)
    return reduced_tensor

# If `tensor` is identical across all devices and the number of devices is 1,
# this could trigger the AllReduceSimplifier optimization.
```

This code represents a high-level pattern and depends on the specific configuration and execution environment (like the number of devices and whether the tensor is replicated across them) to trigger the optimization in TensorFlow XLA.
