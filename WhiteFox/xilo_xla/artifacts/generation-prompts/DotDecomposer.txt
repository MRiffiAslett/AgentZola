The model should contain a non-canonical dot operation. A dot operation is considered non-canonical if it has more than one contracting dimension, or if it has more than one non-contracting dimension, or if it has no batch dimensions and no contracting dimensions. 

In addition, the batch dimensions, if present, must be canonical. This means that the batch dimensions should be in ascending order starting from 0. 

Here is an example of a non-canonical dot operation in TensorFlow:

```python
# Assume a and b are tensors with shapes (3, 2, 4) and (3, 4, 2) respectively
c = tf.tensordot(a, b, axes=[[1, 2], [2, 1]])
```

In this example, the dot operation is non-canonical because it has more than one contracting dimension. The `DotDecomposer` optimization pass will be triggered to canonicalize this dot operation.
