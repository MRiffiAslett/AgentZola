The model should contain a `HloReduceScatterInstruction` operation that is an array. This operation is a collective operation that combines values across multiple devices and scatters the result. 

The `ReduceScatterDecomposer` optimization pass is triggered when the model contains a `HloReduceScatterInstruction` that meets the following conditions:

1. The `HloReduceScatterInstruction` operation is an array. This is checked by `rs->shape().IsArray()`.
2. The `should_decompose_` function, if provided, returns true when called with the `HloReduceScatterInstruction` as an argument. This is checked by `should_decompose_ && !should_decompose_(rs)`.

The `ReduceScatterDecomposer` optimization pass decomposes the `HloReduceScatterInstruction` into an all-reduce operation followed by a dynamic slice operation. The all-reduce operation combines values across multiple devices, and the dynamic slice operation scatters the result. 

The model triggers the `ReduceScatterDecomposer` optimization pass if it contains a `HloReduceScatterInstruction` that meets the conditions above. The pass will return true if it successfully decomposes at least one `HloReduceScatterInstruction`.
