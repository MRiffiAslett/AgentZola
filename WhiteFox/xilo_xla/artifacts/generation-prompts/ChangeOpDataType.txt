The model should contain an operation that matches the pattern defined by `op_matcher_` and has all its operands of the same data type, which is also present in the `to_type_map_`. The operation should not be a parameter and its output should be an array. 

Here is an example of such a pattern:

```python
t1 = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
t2 = tf.constant([4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.float32)
result = tf.add(t1, t2)
```

In this example, the `tf.add` operation matches the `op_matcher_` pattern, all its operands are of the same data type (`tf.float32`), and its output is an array. If `tf.float32` is present in the `to_type_map_`, then the `ChangeOpDataType` optimization pass will be triggered.
