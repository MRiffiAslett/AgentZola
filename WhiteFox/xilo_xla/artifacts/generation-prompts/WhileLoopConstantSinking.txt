The model should contain a while loop where the initial value of the loop is a tuple and at least one of the elements of the tuple is a constant or a broadcast of a constant. This constant value should be used inside the loop body or condition but does not change during the execution of the loop. 

Here is an example of such a pattern in TensorFlow:

```python
i = tf.constant(0)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i, 10)
b = lambda i: (tf.add(i, 1), )
r = tf.while_loop(c, b, (i,))
```

In this example, `i` is a constant that is used in the loop condition `c` and the loop body `b`, but its value does not change during the execution of the loop. Therefore, the `WhileLoopConstantSinking` optimization pass can be triggered. 

Note that the optimization pass can also be triggered if the constant value is used in a broadcast operation inside the loop. For example:

```python
i = tf.constant(0)
c = lambda i: tf.less(i, 10)
b = lambda i: (tf.add(i, tf.broadcast_to(1, [2, 2])), )
r = tf.while_loop(c, b, (i,))
```

In this example, the constant `1` is used in a broadcast operation inside the loop body `b`. Since the value of `1` does not change during the execution of the loop, the `WhileLoopConstantSinking` optimization pass can be triggered.
