### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopConstantSinking` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The TensorFlow XLA optimization pass `WhileLoopConstantSinking` is triggered when specific conditions are met in a TensorFlow model involving `while` loops. Below is a concise description of the model characteristics that would activate this pass:

1. **While Loop with Tuple Initialization:**
   The optimization targets `while` loops where the initial condition (`init_value`) is a tuple. Each element of this tuple is checked to determine if it can be treated as a constant or a broadcast of a constant throughout the loop.

   ```python
   init_value = (const1, const2, ..., constN)
   while_loop = tf.while_loop(cond, body, [init_value])
   ```

2. **Invariant Loop Values:**
   The optimization evaluates each element of the tuple used to initialize the loop. For an element to be considered, it must either be:
   - A constant.
   - A broadcast of a constant (if the `sink_broadcast_of_constants_` flag is enabled).

   This is checked using:
   ```python
   if invariant_value.opcode() == tf.constant or 
      (sink_broadcast_of_constants_ and invariant_value.opcode() == tf.broadcast and invariant_value.operand(0).opcode() == tf.constant):
   ```

3. **Scalar Constants Condition:**
   If the `sink_only_scalar_constants_` flag is enabled, the optimization is further restricted to only consider scalar constants. This means non-scalar constants (e.g., matrices or vectors) will not trigger this optimization unless they are scalar.

   ```python
   if sink_only_scalar_constants_ and not is_scalar(init_value.operand(index).shape()):
       continue
   ```

4. **Usage in While Loop Body:**
   The target constant or broadcast constant must be used inside the loop body and not just be part of the loop's condition or solely passed through without modification. Specifically, it should have more than one usage in the loop body to be considered for sinking.

5. **Effect on Loop Body and Condition:**
   When these conditions are met, the optimization clones the loop body and condition where applicable, replacing the relevant uses of the loop-invariant value with the identified constant or broadcast of a constant. This reduces computation within the loop by eliminating the need to recompute or re-fetch these invariant values in each iteration.

Example TensorFlow model pattern in Python that would trigger this optimization:

```python
x = tf.constant(5)  # Loop-invariant value
y = tf.constant(10)  # Another loop-invariant value

def condition(i, max_iter):
    return i < max_iter

def body(i, max_iter):
    # Operations inside the loop that use 'x' and 'y'
    return i + 1, max_iter

max_iterations = tf.constant(100)
result = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [0, max_iterations])
```

In this example, constants `x`, `y`, and `max_iterations` could potentially be optimized by the `WhileLoopConstantSinking` pass if they are properly integrated and used within the loop's body and meet the conditions outlined above.
