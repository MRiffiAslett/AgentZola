### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Description of TensorFlow Model Characteristics for `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` Optimization

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization in TensorFlow XLA is triggered when a model contains a sequence of two reshape operations whereby the second reshape operation reverses the effect of the first reshape operation. Specifically, the characteristics that trigger this optimization are:

1. There are two consecutive reshape operations in the model.
2. The first reshape operation changes the shape of an input tensor to any arbitrary new shape.
3. The second reshape operation changes the tensor back to its original shape.

#### Code Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor of arbitrary shape
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform(shape=[4, 4])

# First reshape operation to change the shape
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [16])

# Second reshape operation to revert to the original shape
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [4, 4])
```
In the above example, `t1` and `t2` correspond to the two reshape operations. The optimization would recognize that `t2` simply undoes the reshape performed by `t1` and would optimize this by eliminating the unnecessary reshaping, directly using `input_tensor` where `t2` is used.

### Description of TensorFlow Model Characteristics for `WhileLoopConstantSinking` Optimization

The `WhileLoopConstantSinking` optimization is triggered when there are constants that can be moved into the body of a while loop to potentially reduce the computational overhead. The characteristics that trigger this optimization are:

1. The model contains a while loop.
2. The initial values of the while loop (provided by the tuple at the beginning of the loop) contain constants or broadcasts of constants.
3. These constants are invariant across iterations of the loop – they do not change as the loop executes.
4. Optionally, if the `sink_only_scalar_constants` flag is set, these constants must be scalars.

#### Code Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Scalar constant to be sunk into the loop
constant_value = tf.constant(5)

def cond(i, max_iter):
    return i < max_iter

def body(i, val):
    # Operations inside the loop that can use `val`
    return i + 1, val * 2

# While loop where `constant_value` can be sunk
result = tf.while_loop(cond, body, [0, constant_value], maximum_iterations=10)
```
In this example, `constant_value` is a constant that is passed into the while loop and used in the loop body. If the loop's operations do not modify `constant_value`, and it is eligible for sinking, the optimization would move `constant_value` directly into the loop body, potentially replacing multiple uses inside the loop with a single constant definition.
