The model should contain a broadcast operation where the dimensions are not sorted. The pattern describes a broadcast operation that expands the shape of a tensor to a larger shape, and the dimensions of the broadcast are not in ascending order.

Here is an example of such a pattern in TensorFlow:

```python
input_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])  # shape (3,)
broadcast_tensor = tf.broadcast_to(input_tensor, [3, 3, 3])  # shape (3, 3, 3)
```

In this example, the broadcast operation expands the shape of `input_tensor` from `(3,)` to `(3, 3, 3)`. The dimensions of the broadcast are `[0, 1, 2]`, which are already sorted. If the dimensions were not sorted (e.g., `[2, 0, 1]`), this would trigger the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` optimization pass.
