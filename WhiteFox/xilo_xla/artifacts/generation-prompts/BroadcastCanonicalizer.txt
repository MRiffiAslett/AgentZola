### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` in TensorFlow XLA

The TensorFlow model will trigger the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` optimization when it contains a `Broadcast` operation with unsorted broadcasting dimensions. The optimization targets these specific patterns to reorganize the broadcasting dimensions into a sorted order and adjusts the resultant tensor shape to match the original, through transposition.

#### Model Pattern Example

Here's an example illustrating the model characteristics that would fit this pattern:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume `input_tensor` has shape [1, H, W]
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([1, 100, 100])

# Broadcasting `input_tensor` with unsorted dimensions
# For instance, broadcasting the second dimension
broadcasted_tensor = tf.broadcast_to(input_tensor, [100, 1, 100])

# This results in a tensor where the broadcasting dimensions are not sorted.
# In TensorFlow XLA, this would trigger the BroadcastCanonicalizer to sort
# these dimensions and apply a transpose to align the output back to the expected shape.
```

In this example:
- `input_tensor` is broadcasted to a new shape `[100, 1, 100]` where the dimensions intended for broadcasting (from `[1, H, W]` to `[100, 1, 100]`) are not in an ascending order.
- The `BroadcastCanonicalizer` would detect this unsorted order in the `dimensions` attribute of the broadcast operation, sort them, and then apply a transpose to ensure the output tensor retains the correct logical shape alignment as per the original non-broadcasted dimensions.

This model characteristic specifically involves the use of a `Broadcast` operation where the `dimensions` attribute (indicating which axes in the input tensor are being broadcasted to match the output shape) is not sorted in ascending order. The optimizer's goal here is to canonicalize such operations to improve execution efficiency and potentially enable further optimizations.
