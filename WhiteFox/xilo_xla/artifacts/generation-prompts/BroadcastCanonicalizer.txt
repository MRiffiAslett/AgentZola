### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)




### Characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA:

The `BroadcastCanonicalizer` optimization is triggered in TensorFlow XLA when the model contains a broadcast operation where the dimensions of the broadcast are not in a sorted order. This means that the indices specified in the `dimensions` attribute of the broadcast operation are not in ascending order.

#### Example:
In TensorFlow, a broadcast operation can be represented as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming `input_tensor` has a shape of [3, 1]
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1], [2], [3]])

# Broadcasting `input_tensor` to a shape [3, 2] without sorted dimensions
# Suppose the broadcast dimensions are specified as [1, 0] which is not sorted
broadcasted_tensor = tf.broadcast_to(input_tensor, [2, 3])
```

In this example:
- `input_tensor` has a shape of `[3, 1]`.
- It is broadcasted to a new shape `[2, 3]`.
- The broadcast dimensions `[1, 0]` are not in a sorted order.

This type of operation in a TensorFlow XLA model would trigger the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` optimization. The pass would then adjust the order of the broadcast dimensions to be sorted and introduce necessary operations (like transpose) to preserve the semantics of the original model while improving its efficiency or execution characteristics.

### Summary:
For the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` to be triggered, the model should include a broadcast operation where the broadcast dimensions (`dimensions` attribute) are not sorted in ascending order. The optimization pass will then reorder these dimensions and potentially adjust the operation graph to maintain correct output while optimizing execution.
