Generate a valid TensorFlow model for HloConstantFolding that meets the requirements.

The `HloConstantFolding` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered for a TensorFlow model when specific characteristics and patterns are met in the model's HLO (High-Level Optimizer) instructions. Below are the key characteristics that can lead this optimization to be triggered:

### Characteristics of the Model

1. **Presence of Constant Operands**: The primary trigger for this optimization is the presence of operations that have at least one operand as a constant (`kConstant`). This is a basic requirement for attempting constant folding.

2. **All Operands are Constants or Broadcasts of Constants**: The operation must either involve all constant operands or operations where operands are broadcasts of constants. An example is an operation like addition where both operands are constants or one is a broadcast of a constant.

   ```python
   # TensorFlow equivalent
   tf.add(tf.constant([1, 2, 3]), tf.broadcast_to(tf.constant(1), [3]))
   ```

3. **Non-Side-Effecting Operations**: The operations should not have side effects. Operations like random number generation (`kRng`) and those that manage control flow or synchronization tokens (`kAfterAll`) are excluded from folding.

4. **Size Constraints on Operations and Constants**: There are specific size constraints to prevent performance degradation due to excessively large constants. If the operands or the resulting constant exceed a predefined size limit (e.g., 45 million elements), the operation will not be folded.

5. **Foldable Computations Only**: If a computation (or a nested subcomputation) contains non-foldable operations as determined by various checks (e.g., operation types like `kBroadcast`, `kIota`, `kFft`, and presence of side effects), then the computation is not considered foldable, and constant folding won't be applied.

6. **No Control Dependencies**: The instructions targeted for constant folding should not have control dependencies. This ensures that the semantics related to execution order and control are not disturbed.

7. **Exclusion of Certain Operations**: Certain operations, even if all operands are constants, are not folded by default. These include parameter instructions (`kParameter`), constants themselves (`kConstant`), and tuple constructions (`kTuple`).

### Example Model

Consider a simple TensorFlow model where constant folding might be applied:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example where constant folding can be applied
x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
z = tf.add(x, y)  # This can be folded to [5.0, 7.0, 9.0]

# Example where constant folding won't be applied due to size
large_constant1 = tf.constant(list(range(100000000)))  # 100 million elements
large_constant2 = tf.constant(list(range(100000000)))
result = tf.add(large_constant1, large_constant2)  # Won't be folded due to size constraints
```

In this example, the addition of `x` and `y` can be constant folded because both operands are small constants, but the addition involving `large_constant1` and `large_constant2` will not be folded due to the size constraint.
