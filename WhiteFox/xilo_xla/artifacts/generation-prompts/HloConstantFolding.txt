### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

### Characteristics of TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding`:

The `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains a sequence of two `tf.reshape` operations where:

1. The first `tf.reshape` operation changes the shape of an input tensor (`input_tensor`) to any arbitrary shape.
2. The second `tf.reshape` operation immediately following the first one reverts the tensor back to its original shape.

This pattern suggests an unnecessary reshape operation that does not change the data but adds computational overhead. The optimization eliminates this redundant operation.

#### Example Model:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original shape of the input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal([10, 20])

# First reshape operation to change the shape
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [200])

# Second reshape operation to revert to the original shape
reverted_tensor = tf.reshape(reshaped_tensor, [10, 20])
```
In this example, the model exhibits the characteristics needed to trigger the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization, as the output of the second reshape (`reverted_tensor`) has the same shape as the `input_tensor`.

### Characteristics of TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `HloConstantFolding`:

The `HloConstantFolding` optimization is triggered when a TensorFlow model contains operations that can be evaluated at compile-time because they operate on constant values. The characteristics of such a model include:

1. Operations where all operands are constants or can be reduced to constants (like broadcasts of constants).
2. The absence of operations that are inherently non-foldable due to side effects, randomness, or specific exclusion due to performance considerations (like `kRng`, `kAfterAll`, `kWhile`, `kFft`).

This optimization attempts to evaluate expressions during the compilation process to reduce runtime computation.

#### Example Model:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Constant tensors
const1 = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
const2 = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

# A foldable operation on constant tensors
result = tf.add(const1, const2)
```
In this example, since both operands of the `tf.add` operation are constants, the `HloConstantFolding` optimization can pre-compute the result at compile-time, thus reducing runtime computations.
