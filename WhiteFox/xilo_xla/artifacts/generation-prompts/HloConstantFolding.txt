The TensorFlow model triggers the optimization pass `HloConstantFolding` when it contains operations where at least one operand is a constant and all other operands are either constants or broadcasts of constants. 

The model should not contain instructions that are side-effecting, have control dependencies, or are of type `kBroadcast`, `kIota`, `kFft`, `kWhile`, `kAfterAll`, or `kRng`. 

The model should also not contain instructions that are or transitively contain an instruction that is marked as side-effecting or takes an explicit seed. 

The model should not contain instructions that have a shape size greater than 45 million elements. 

The model should not contain instructions that are `kPad` with a broadcast operand and a constant operand. 

The model should not contain instructions that are asynchronous and have a different execution thread than their parent. 

The model should not contain computations that are only used by call instructions and do not have identical constant parameters. 

Here is an example of a model that would trigger this optimization pass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a constant tensor
x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Define a broadcast tensor
y = tf.broadcast_to(x, [3, 5])

# Define an operation with constant and broadcast operands
z = tf.add(x, y)
```

In this example, the `tf.add` operation has one operand that is a constant (`x`) and one operand that is a broadcast of a constant (`y`). Therefore, this operation would trigger the `HloConstantFolding` optimization pass.
