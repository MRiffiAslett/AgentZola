### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `SliceConcatForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain a pattern where a 1-D concatenation is followed by a slice
that extracts exactly one of the original operands:
```
c = tf.concat([a1, a2, ..., an], axis=0)   # all operands are 1-D
result = tf.slice(c, [start], [size])        # or c[start:start+size]
```
Requirements:
- All tensors must be rank 1 (1-D).
- The slice stride must be 1 (contiguous).
- The slice must exactly align with the boundary of one of the concatenated operands
  (start equals the cumulative size of all preceding operands, and size equals that
  operand's dimension).
The optimization forwards the matching operand directly, bypassing the concat+slice.
