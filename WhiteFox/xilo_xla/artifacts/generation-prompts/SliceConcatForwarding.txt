The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.concat([input_tensor1, input_tensor2, ..., input_tensorN], axis=0)
t2 = tf.slice(t1, [start], [size])
```
The pattern describes that there is a `concat` operator followed by a `slice` operator in the model. The `concat` operator concatenates a list of tensors `[input_tensor1, input_tensor2, ..., input_tensorN]` along the first dimension (axis=0). The `slice` operator then slices the concatenated tensor `t1` starting from `start` and the size of the slice is `size`.

The characteristics that trigger the `SliceConcatForwarding` optimization are:

1. The `slice` operator must slice a tensor that is the result of a `concat` operation.
2. The `slice` operation must be along the first dimension (axis=0).
3. The size of the slice must be 1.
4. The stride of the slice must be 1.
5. The start of the slice must align with the start of one of the concatenated tensors, and the size of the slice must be equal to the size of that tensor.
