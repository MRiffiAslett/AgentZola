The model should contain collective operations that meet certain conditions. The collective operations include `AllReduce`, `AllGather`, `CollectiveBroadcast`, `CollectivePermute`, `AllToAll`, `ReduceScatter`, and `RaggedAllToAll`. 

For each of these operations, the model should meet the following conditions:

1. For `AllReduce` and `AllGather`, the size of the shape of the operation should be greater than or equal to the minimum threshold defined in the configuration (`all_reduce_min_threshold_in_bytes` and `all_gather_min_threshold_in_bytes` respectively).

2. For `CollectiveBroadcast`, `CollectivePermute`, `AllToAll`, `ReduceScatter`, and `RaggedAllToAll`, there are no additional conditions specified in the code.

The model should also contain non-fusion computations that contain these collective operations. 

Here is an example of a model that would trigger this optimization pass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume that the following tensors are distributed across multiple devices
tensor_a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
tensor_b = tf.constant([5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0])

# AllReduce operation
reduced = tf.reduce_sum([tensor_a, tensor_b])

# AllGather operation
gathered = tf.concat([tensor_a, tensor_b], axis=0)

# CollectivePermute operation
permuted = tf.raw_ops.CollectivePermute(tensors=[tensor_a, tensor_b], perm=[(0, 1), (1, 0)])

# The model should contain non-fusion computations that include these operations
```

In this example, the `AllReduce`, `AllGather`, and `CollectivePermute` operations would trigger the `AsyncCollectiveCreator` optimization pass if their shape sizes meet the minimum threshold defined in the configuration.
