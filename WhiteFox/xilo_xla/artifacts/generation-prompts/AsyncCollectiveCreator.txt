Generate a valid TensorFlow model for AsyncCollectiveCreator that meets the requirements.

The TensorFlow model characteristics that would trigger the `AsyncCollectiveCreator` optimization primarily revolve around the presence and configuration of collective operations within the model's computations. Here are the details:

### Presence of Specific Collective Operations
The model must use one or more of the following collective operations to potentially trigger this optimization:
- `AllReduce`
- `AllGather`
- `CollectivePermute`
- `CollectiveBroadcast`
- `AllToAll`
- `ReduceScatter`
- `RaggedAllToAll`

### Configuration and Size Constraints
For `AllReduce` and `AllGather` operations specifically, the size of the data being processed must meet certain thresholds. This is checked against `config_.all_reduce_min_threshold_in_bytes` for `AllReduce` and `config_.all_gather_min_threshold_in_bytes` for `AllGather`. If the data size is below these thresholds, the operations won't be converted to their asynchronous counterparts.

### Usage Example
Here's an illustrative example of a TensorFlow model operation that might trigger this optimization if the size conditions are met:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume large enough tensors to meet the byte size thresholds
tensor1 = tf.random.uniform([1000, 1000], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor2 = tf.random.uniform([1000, 1000], dtype=tf.float32)

# AllReduce operation which could be converted to an asynchronous version
summed_tensor = tf.raw_ops.CollectiveReduce(input=tensor1, group_size=1, group_key=1, instance_key=1,
                                            merge_op='Add', final_op='Id', subdiv_offsets=[0])

# AllGather operation potentially triggering async optimization
gathered_tensors = tf.raw_ops.CollectiveGather(input=tensor2, group_size=1, group_key=1, instance_key=2,
                                               subdiv_offsets=[0])
```

In summary, the `AsyncCollectiveCreator` is triggered by the use of specific collective operations within TensorFlow models, particularly when these operations process data sizes that exceed predefined thresholds. This optimization pass converts synchronous collective operations into their asynchronous counterparts, potentially improving the performance of distributed TensorFlow models by allowing other computations to proceed without waiting for the collective operations to complete.
