The model should contain the following patterns:

1. A dot operation where at least one of the operands is a non-identity transpose operation. A non-identity transpose operation is one where the dimensions of the transpose operation are not in the same order as the original dimensions. For example:

```python
t1 = tf.transpose(input_tensor, perm=[1, 0, 2])
t2 = tf.linalg.matmul(t1, another_tensor)
```

In this case, `t1` is a non-identity transpose operation because the permutation `[1, 0, 2]` is not the same as the original order `[0, 1, 2]`. The `matmul` operation is equivalent to a dot operation in TensorFlow.

2. A convolution operation where at least one of the operands is a transpose operation. For example:

```python
t1 = tf.transpose(input_tensor, perm=[1, 0, 2])
t2 = tf.nn.conv2d(t1, filter, strides, padding)
```

In this case, `t1` is a transpose operation and `conv2d` is equivalent to a convolution operation in TensorFlow. The `TransposeFolding` optimization pass can fold the transpose operation into the convolution operation, effectively removing the transpose operation.
