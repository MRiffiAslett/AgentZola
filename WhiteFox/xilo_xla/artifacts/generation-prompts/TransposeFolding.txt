Generate a valid TensorFlow model for TransposeFolding that meets the requirements.

The `TransposeFolding` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA specifically targets situations where transpose operations can be merged into neighboring convolution or dot (matrix multiplication) operations, thereby simplifying the overall computation and potentially enhancing performance. This optimization is triggered under the following conditions in a TensorFlow model:

1. **Convolution with Transposed Input or Kernel:**
   - The model has a convolution operation (`kConvolution`) where either the input or the kernel (or both) is preceded by a transpose operation (`kTranspose`).
   - The transpositions of the operands (input or kernel) must align with the convolution's dimension numbers in a way that they can be "folded" into the convolution operation itself. This means adjusting the convolution's dimension numbers according to the permutations specified by the transposes.
   - An example scenario is when a convolution's input feature or batch dimension is permuted, and this permutation can be directly absorbed into the convolution's specification.

   ```python
   # Example TensorFlow (Python) code:
   import tensorflow as tf

   # Input and filter with a transpose operation before convolution
   input_tensor = tf.random.normal([1, 28, 28, 3])  # [batch, height, width, channels]
   filter_tensor = tf.random.normal([5, 5, 3, 32])

   # Transposed input and/or filter
   transposed_input = tf.transpose(input_tensor, perm=[0, 3, 1, 2])  # Transposing to [batch, channels, height, width]
   transposed_filter = tf.transpose(filter_tensor, perm=[1, 0, 2, 3])  # Example permutation

   # Convolution operation
   result = tf.nn.conv2d(transposed_input, transposed_filter, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
   ```

2. **Dot Product with Transposed Operands:**
   - The model includes a dot product (`kDot`) where one or both operands are preceded by a transpose operation.
   - The transpose operations adjust the contracting and/or batch dimensions of the dot product operands.
   - The transpose can be folded if it results in a configuration where the transposed dimensions of the operands align appropriately with the dot product's dimension requirements.
   - This optimization is particularly relevant when handling matrix multiplications in neural networks, where transposing matrices can reorder dimensions for alignment or other reasons.

   ```python
   # Example TensorFlow (Python) code:
   a = tf.random.normal([10, 64])  # Operand 1
   b = tf.random.normal([64, 10])  # Operand 2

   # Transposing operand b
   transposed_b = tf.transpose(b)  # Transpose to align for matrix multiplication

   # Dot product
   result = tf.linalg.matmul(a, transposed_b)
   ```

These optimizations reduce the computational overhead by eliminating unnecessary transpose operations, thereby streamlining the execution of the model on hardware accelerators supported by XLA. Such optimizations are crucial for performance-sensitive applications like deep learning inference and training.
