### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `IdentityReshapeRemoving` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain a reshape operation where the target shape is identical to
the input shape:
```
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])   # shape [2, 2]
y = tf.reshape(x, [2, 2])                     # identity reshape: [2,2] -> [2,2]
```
The optimization removes redundant `tf.reshape` calls where the output shape matches
the input shape exactly, directly forwarding the input tensor.
